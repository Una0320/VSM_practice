languag f p 105 georgian f articl type cso f p 106 articl by temur mirianashvili a good stone doesn t quit f the wall thought on today s emigr text these day we keep repeat niko lortkipanidz s word georgia is be sold off inde georgia s copper and timber work of art and histor relic are be sold off in short anyth that can be sold and haul off the worst harm howev is be done by what is univers call the brain drain and univers consid nation self genocid obvious we haven t realiz the danger pose by the brain drain despit the fact that our best artist scientist specialist businessmen and athlet are leav georgia our fittest and smartest youth are leav georgia yet we seem almost proud that our elit are emigr our terribl sick snobbism is to blame for thi strang pride we rejoic in ani contact with the west even if it is destruct the brain drain is bad enough for the nation but most of the draine themselv are not veri well off onli a hand have decent live in the west to say noth of a happi life let alon one of luxuri there are more than 25 million unemploy person in the countri of the european union they can t find job for their own qualifi cadr so are they suppos to clasp graduat of soviet colleg or nongradu to their bosom henc our emigr have to take the kind of job which the nativ there won t touch some can t even get those job and have to support themselv by crime and prostitut some even take the easier rout beg true the western beggar is materi better off than a scientist here but materi wellb alon doesn t make a life it s sad to have to argu these thing now in georgia so that you won t think that i am against all emigr i ll tri to make myself more clear there are two kind of emigr polit and econom the polit emigr is someon who goe abroad becaus he is be persecut at home on polit ground hi life and liberti are threaten or he is ban from work in hi profess you cannot accus polit emigr of unconcern for their countri s fate or of shirk their patriot duti econom emigr howev do deserv that accus the econom emigr is also one who claim that he is go abroad in order to have better work condit to work more fruit and eventu benefit hi homeland our elit should not use such thing as the econom crisi the paralysi of industri and materi want as excus to seek the good life abroad rather they should do everyth they can to reviv the economi revit scienc and restor industri here otherwis georgia will perish all countri have suffer crise but the onli one which have surviv are those whose most gift and knowledg citizen have fought and done everyth they could to save their homeland no countri can get ahead ani other way mani of our fellow countrymen becam polit emigr both under the communist and under the round the gamsakhurdia regim most of them were dedic to their countri and for them it wa a tragedi to have to go abroad offici propaganda revil them and natur our peopl tend to sympath with the emigr today polit emigr from georgia is unnecessari becaus no one is persecut on polit ground and no one is ban from profession activ henc attitud toward would be emigr ought to chang in my opinion georgian emigr today is of three categori the first categori compris the major of those who have left their homeland these peopl are more or less essenti to georgia in the west howev which ha ten of million of unemploy specialist of it own nobodi need georgian seeker of the good life henc their effort abroad neither bring glori to their homeland nor do them much good materi in fact mani of them though i wouldn t say thi of everi emigr in thi categori bring shame and disgrac to georgia with their beg crime prostitut and other unworthi action the second categori compris a small minor of georgian emigr these are peopl who have a certain amount of author sometim high prestig in the west and are of cours materi well off there are those who justifi these peopl s live abroad after all mani have brought fame to georgia and have even help us with hard currenc i person howev think that they are much more essenti in georgia quit asid from the preciou valu of the activ of scientist and specialist when peopl are in troubl their effort are magnifi a hundredfold by work side by side with emin countrymen gift artist can greatli allevi their countrymen s heavi burden all els asid the moral exampl which the popular celebr set for ordinari peopl who have remain in their cold and hungri homeland is priceless as for bring renown to georgia in the world and gener hard currenc that can be done without pull up root for exampl by tour gastroli the third categori compris student who are temporari emigr so to speak after complet their studi they ought to come back to georgia they ought to but i m certain that mani of them do not intend to do so and won t if they can get citizenship abroad i know mani will disagre with me but i think it is wrong to go abroad to school especi on such a mass scale someon will no doubt remind me of ilia chavchavadz akaki tseret vazha pshavela and the other tergdaleulebi drinker of the terek 19th centuri georgian who went to russia to colleg and return to lead georgia ye ye i know but in the time of the tergdaleulebi it wa imposs to get a higher educ in georgia we didn t have univers and professor our librari hold were extrem small the situat is entir differ today a dilig youngster can get a high qualiti educ even without leav georgia second sure no one imagin that anyon among that brilliant constel of tergdaleulebi would choos to stay in a foreign countri even a foreign countri s librari at a time when georgia wa in a grave crisi at war and the nation wa fight for it veri life also consid thi there are rumor from the west that most of our young peopl there are not studi veri hard these report are come by the grapevin and also from student who have been there just read and listen to what dato turashvili and other have to say they practic never mention the interior of librari and univers lectur hall instead georgia s futur pride talk lavishli about drink drug and get laid some reader may think i m overli exagger and categor but i must repeat what i firmli believ georgia can onli be save if it son and daughter especi the gift and talent one do their civic duti georgian shouldn t seek haven in other countri just becaus life in georgia is hard they should tri to make life better here it ha never been easi to build a countri we also need to learn that life is more than mere enough food warmth and entertain life is much deeper and more wonder it is a misfortun of cours to live in a devast countri but it is happi to rebuild a devast countri it is happi just to tri rememb the georgian proverb a good stone doesn t quit the wall i quot it not becaus i think our emigr are bad stone not at all i don t consid them to be quitter from georgia s wall it s just that most of them have not thought their posit through probabl onli a veri few of our emigr are like bad stone or like rat who are the first to leav a ship in troubl and incident the first to die georgia will certainli surviv and win there will certainli be a real georgian celebr in georgia and then all our countrymen will yearn to come home but those who stood by georgia to the end in time of troubl and those who stay safe and warm in a foreign countri will never eat and drink at the same parti not becaus anybodi will be lock out of that georgian celebr but becaus some will be content men in the civil west they attain the standard of live where most citizen are content with their lot while the other will be happi men there is no greater happi than to take part in your homeland s victori the content man and the happi man have noth in common becaus content and happi are mutual exclus p s a few word about peopl who are get rich off the brain drain someon name giorgi bagaturia wrote in iveria ekspresi last summer that he had creat a compani which help highli train georgian specialist becom australian citizen bagaturia emphas that onli top specialist need appli so thi man is get rich by sell hi own peopl hi own kind unfortun the bagaturia have prolifer among us some newspap for exampl publish photo of foreign men seek friendli ladi but the friendli georgian ladi for some reason have to be young and good look is friendship possibl onli with a woman one who is beauti and young you can tell from their photo moreov that mani of these friendli men are sex maniac what we are see in georgia then is the emerg of the heir of those who market their own flesh and blood in the bazaar of istanbul and cairo in past centuri
