bfn f p 106 interview with brigita schmognerova deputi prime minist f for the economi by ivan stulajt place and date not given we must proceed in a manner ensur that extrem doe not prevail text stulajt it seem that slovakia is significantli nearer to receiv a stand by loan from the intern monetari fund imf in your opinion what wa the differ between the negoti conduct with the imf by vladimir meciar s govern and the negoti carri out a few day ago by jozef moravcik s govern schmognerova in the way the negoti were conduct when i wa appoint i wa in the unit state and i had the opportun to speak with senior offici from the world bank and the imf the upshot of thi wa that immedi follow our request mission from these institut came to slovakia as oppos to the previou negoti the govern submit it own concept for econom polici apart from thi we submit an analysi of the risk face the state budget and also an analysi of the measur for counteract these risk in the past the approach at the negoti wa that the imf drew up the basi for a memorandum on econom polici and the govern then approv it our approach wa much more activ stulajt were there ani differ between the imf and govern repres schmognerova not in the aim we are pursu the imf had point out in the past that transform is slow down significantli then there wa no certitud that the loan would be paid we announc unequivoc that the transform process will be speed up stulajt thi is true but the former govern also in it declar express it support for transform deed are import what will the govern s first step be to improv it credibl vi a vi the imf schmognerova befor the end of the month the govern will submit to the nation council of the slovak republ draft law on valu ad tax consum tax and child allow stulajt the draft law on valu ad tax will obvious proceed from the addendum to the memorandum on the govern s econom polici which talk about amalgam the rate for thi tax schmognerova thi step ha been prepar for a long time the differ howev will be that the rate will not be amalgam but that some item from the 6 0 percent tax bracket will be regroup into the 25 percent bracket it should transpir that the govern will have the possibl to determin by law which product will be burden by the higher rate it will be far more flexibl thi way stulajt can you tell us which product will not be affect by the higher valu ad tax schmognerova basic foodstuff and medicin stulajt by how much will the state budget s revenu be increas schmognerova it could amount to around 3 0 billion koruna stulajt what about the child allow schmognerova the child allow should be more target depend on the minimum subsist multipl howev no decis ha yet been made on the size of thi multipl unfortun at the moment there is no supplementari social system on whose basi we could categor the claim for payment of these benefit if we were to take twice the minimum subsist level as the borderlin for be abl to claim famili allow then child allow would be paid to almost 88 percent of famili if there were a supplementari social system thi percentag could be lower if there were social difficulti in famili that lost their claim to these allow thi situat could be remedi by a form of target assist for exampl by variou social stipend to support educ in high school and univers and so on stulajt will budget save be the outcom of target the payment of child allow schmognerova thi is our aim howev it will not be achiev sinc there are no supplementari system in ani case thi is the first step toward transform the social sphere stulajt in connect with minim the budget risk the govern say in it polici statement that it want to concentr on unfreez outstand claim and on reduc tax and custom evas schmognerova these are measur intend to give one off assist to the state budget tax collect can onli be improv to a certain extent then the effici of the appropri measur becom deplet in principl the same appli to unfreez outstand claim but thi is implement over a longer time frame the decis thing in thi regard howev is whether the declin in the economi ha been halt or at least slow down consider stulajt thi is in fact an issu associ with the develop of the gross domest product in thi context what do you intend to concentr on schmognerova definit on develop the privat sector on small and medium size enterpris on halt the declin in the enterpris sphere and on export stulajt as far as export are concern what kind of pro export measur can the govern take schmognerova we would like to expand activ associ with provid insur and possibl credit for export as long as the resourc are found it will be necessari to improv the inform avail to our entrepreneuri sphere on the possibl for export in thi context the govern ha made it it goal to conclud bilater agreement to creat a good foundat for conduct trade stulajt how do you intend to proceed with regard to russia schmognerova i discuss thi with the russian feder s ambassador the question of a link to the ga pipelin that will lead from russia across poland is still open there is great interest in thi project and there will be a certain amount of competit among the interest parti the russian side would be glad if slovakia were to hold it ground in thi competit at the moment we are look veri intens at the option for financ thi project the option are also be outlin for russian help in complet the mochovc nuclear power plant stulajt whi would the russian side be pleas if slovakia were to hold it ground in thi competit schmognerova thi is what the ambassador said stulajt a link to the ga pipelin is one issu anoth is slovak export to the russian market schmognerova the demand for agricultur product ha declin and for thi reason our export potenti is limit in addit what we are abl export come up against strong competit from the european union where foodstuff are heavili subsid the situat is similar with regard to export of engin equip western export receiv veri advantag export credit which slovakia cannot afford despit thi slovak enterpris should tri harder to penetr into thi territori it is often emphas that russian enterpris have payment problem thi is onli part of the truth howev there are also solvent partner there and it is necessari to make contact with them stulajt the issu of the insuffici abil of slovak product to compet on world market is close associ with the lack of foreign capit which would bring advanc technolog and know how what can the govern do to increas the flow of foreign capit to slovakia schmognerova the entri of foreign capit compar with the czech republ or hungari is rather minim for exampl in 1993 the growth of foreign capit in the czech republ wa four time higher than in slovakia dure the same period moreov we also includ capit from the czech land in foreign capit everyon know thi but somehow doe not think it through if the polit situat here is not stabl and predict decent capit will rare come here foreign investor are alarm by the confront statement with regard to the hungarian minor and the extens personnel chang throughout the state administr follow the govern changeov stulajt the issu doe not mere involv the replac of civil servant but the way it is be done schmognerova ye it involv the overal style stulajt what is your opinion of creat advantag for foreign capit by mean of variou kind of tax relief schmognerova i would not overestim thi if there is polit instabl in a countri tax holiday mean littl to foreign investor after all what guarante do they have that they will not be cancel stulajt that wa direct invest what is your view of the entri of foreign capit into privat some warn are be issu about sell off nation properti cheapli about the slovak market be bought out schmognerova we certainli have to be care howev the risk will be reduc in the sens that we will base our decis on the advic of well known and reput consult compani and privat will take place in the form of competit i want to emphas that we are veri interest in foreign investor who have develop plan and know how howev we are not interest in launder dirti money stulajt ha there in fact been money launder schmognerova ye sever case are be investig stulajt the govern ha conceiv a veri broad program it is even be said that some of it intent go beyond it six month mandat on the other hand who continu thi program after the elect is import if we had thought in 1990 1991 and also partli in 1992 that the initi reform were irrevers then the govern of v meciar to say the least cast doubt on thi convict of irrevers thi is a polit commit for the parti that current make up the coalit schmognerova natur each of these parti ha the ambit to continu thi program after the elect as an economist i am veri well awar of how much time ha been wast i enter the govern know that i did not want there to be ani more wast time i realiz that if after the elect those polit forc that were in power previous get into govern onc more then the reform would again be slow down consider or even halt therefor the present govern ha to tri to find a way of establish develop tendenc in the economi and at the same time of not forfeit the peopl s trust stulajt fine but there is a real possibl that those forc you mention will return the govern is now face with the task of bring slovakia s econom and social life out of the consider influenc of the state where polit power is concentr most intens quit simpli it is vital not to give the state a chanc to turn into a dictatorship schmognerova i do not think we are abl to catch all the risk incident there is a risk of undemocrat develop in everi societi take a look at histori there were state that had veri advanc democrat institut but chang still occur in them from the point of view of the current govern it is import that the measur in econom and social polici are such that no prerequisit are creat in slovakia for a victori by extremist stulajt in thi context howev the govern will win the citizen trust by mean of visibl act carri out in the present as measur that will bear fruit at some distant and unspecifi futur time after all who els here care about the futur schmognerova we are work on use the foreign aid that wa and is earmark for slovakia i receiv an analysi drawn up by the foreign ministri on the util of foreign aid in the second half of 1993 you would be surpris at the amount of money we had at our dispos and how littl of it wa use at the same time these are not loan stulajt in view of the fact that you onli have six month and to make sure that the govern s work bear visibl fruit now it is perhap necessari to ask what do we not want to do not becaus the govern would lack suffici will but becaus not veri much can be done in such a short period and the govern may pay dearli for a too widespread span of activ schmognerova i have not thought about it like that but i will contempl it i know one thing howev the govern will not prevent the liquid of ineffici and heavili loss make state enterpris it will onli prevent thi in case where from the point of view of employ in the region it would involv a major enterpris such a measur will onli be taken when altern employ ha been found
