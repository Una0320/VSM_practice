the name of hi possibl successor ha alreadi becom intens mr stanoevski in hi interview with vecer begin to speak sincer about these controversi issu vecer mr stanoevski it is precis in the monetari sphere that there have been open question about the negoti with the world bank that took place last week in skopj were the ambigu clarifi dure the somewhat delay visit of minist trpevski to washington stanoevski dure the negoti with the world bank the particular problem wa voic becaus of their demand that we be veri restrict with respect to further loan to enterpris that are not liquid natur they have demand that the govern or the nbm through it process reliev the bank of that burden and issu a regul through which they would be prohibit from issu credit to enterpris that are not abl to meet their oblig thi issu wa also present to a great extent in dicuss with the imf i person discuss the matter with the chief of the mission who wa here and convinc him that thi demand wa unaccept h5 monetari disagr h5 vecer wa the disagr precis the reason the negoti were abandon at one point stanoevski i did not abandon them i have never abandon ani negoti but on one occas we reach the point at which instead of increas the invest by as much as 21 percent they propos a reduct of six percent we could not accept that and propos anoth solut the increas in the invest of the resourc of the bank could go up to 16 percent the fact that we were unabl to go to a variant growth in the invest so that they would amount to 21 percent wa that the entir program could not be brought befor the board of director so we agre that thi should not be a criterion for fulfil the program we document our doubt that becaus of the fact that a larg number of enterpris were in particularli difficult circumst that instrument could not be put into effect we agre to consult a second time in the second quarter of thi year on the basi on the result that would be achiev dure the first three month the world bank suddenli demand that we refus to offer credit to enterpris that have great loss but those are enterpris with a great number of worker some 20 enterpris have suffer 90 percent of the loss and have about 40 percent of the employe in the economi for the state that would be veri difficult to accept and a compromis solut wa found it wa approv by us and the govern a group of the 25 largest lose enterpris will after present conclud account be abl to use credit from the bank thereaft but onli if the govern guarante them but thi arrang is valid onli until 30 june and after that date the enterpris will be abl to use credit onli if they are creditworthi at the begin the world bank want such a decis to be made by the nbm even though i think that the nbm doe not have the author to introduc such a regul now it is necessari for the govern to do it and the nbm assum the oblig in the second quarter from the possibl growth of denar invest which amount to 608 million denar to ensur 300 million denar to be use onli by these enterpris we will devot the remain 308 million denar to the use of the remain enterpris the nbm will issu that regul otherwis as far as the method for grant credit to the greatest loser up to 30 june the govern held a special session at which each of it member had to declar whether he wa prepar to accept that oblig vecer januari 15 will be rememb as the date on which the board of director of the intern monetari fund met and the program had to be verifi but could that deadlin not be extend somehow stanoevski no the imf and world bank board did not set the date in advanc accord to the latest inform the meet of the imf board of director wa set for yesterday i think that the program will pass without difficulti becaus we succeed in reach an agreement about these detail in the past few day on 8 februari the world bank board will meet and i think that there will not be ani problem there either vecer it mean that the posit on our side are also in agreement how is it that we found out on wednesday that you had a meet with prime minist crvenkovski and other minist who are involv in the work stanoevski everyth is in agreement there are no open question all the technic problem associ with provid resourc for get through and settl oblig toward the bank should be complet by the middl of next month which will be follow by withdraw against the first tranch vecer will we pay off the debt ourselv or will there be an altern wherebi holland or the central bank in zurich will do it first and then we would settl with them stanoevski it will be a combin the main debt which reach it deadlin for payment at the end of septemb and amount to about 107 million should be paid at onc through the bank for transfer to the account in zurich and in conjunct with the netherland central bank later we will settl the debt to them either with resourc from donor or from our reserv otherwis up to now about 27 million ha been agre upon by the donor part of which ha been paid in advanc and part of which await decis by the govern of those countri those are the percentag at the present time the donor assist will be about 35 million but the process of acquir the donor assist will be extend throughout the entir year vecer will the soro credit be left out of the combin stanoevski no the soro foundat is not left out of the combin thereaft to surviv we will incur debt of 25 million if everyth is pass by our parliament of cours h5 expand independ h5 vecer sinc may last year the central bank ha gain greater autonomi in it activ abov all vi a vi the govern how do you evalu such a loosen trend stanoevski you see the central bank is quasi autonom in it activ which is a consequ of the constitut of the republ of macedonia as far as it work is concern the bank is basic respons to the parliament howev in the true mean of the word autonomi an independ central bank doe not exist anywher in the world as the bank direct monetari polici which is onli one segment of the macroeconom polici of a state which is propos enact and carri out by the govern here it mean that a veri close coexistenti and routin cooper must exist in that context it is understood that there can often be disagr howev there are frequent discuss about the extent to which a measur from the aspect of monetari polici is accept to the govern vecer is there an unwritten rule about how much the central bank is independ in it work and how much the govern want to focu attent on itself stanoevski perhap there is some truth in that i do not know how to approach that question you should ask the govern that vecer last spring the legal decis need by the nation bank to enabl the central bank to gain a greater degre of autonomi in it activ vi a vi the state organ had great difficulti in get pass it is even said that the govern accept the measur under pressur from the imf it is also interest thi metamorphosi of the leadership of the nbm from our conserv attitud with respect to the monetari sovereignti of macedonia to the hard work at least under our circumst of take radic step for the greater independ of the central bank stanoevski we have not been conserv when the issu of monetari independ aros even though to a foreign it may have appear that way you know 1991 wa a veri except year in the parliament those preliminari step were taken for three or four month we had no elect govern the prioriti wa to get decis with polit substanc actual that year not a singl item from the econom sphere came befor the parliament vecer okay do you treat monetari independ onli as an econom problem stanoevski it is a multifacet problem in 1991 we made good use of 11 percent of the emiss from the nation bank of yugoslavia even though accord to the size of the social product we could have exploit at most 5 5 percent and bought currenc reserv from the nation bank of yugoslavia to the magnitud of 197 million dollar and that is 17 5 percent of the total currenc sold by the nation bank of yugoslavia for that year we did not buy that much currenc in the three previou year that year macedonia wa swim in gasolin so we began build currenc reserv vecer in what way did the govern transgress in order to accept the measur for greater independ of the central bank last spring even though the member of the cabinet of mr crvenkovski did not in the end agre with such an altern stanoevski no they did not agre they were just indecis i tell you frankli that we were also hesit i endur great apprehens over the chang imagin we who for 50 year were on a fix cours suddenli had to chang to a cours determin by the market gener speak it wa not simpl meanwhil i must say here that at the begin there were still mani progress in the govern who support thi program we had a much greater misunderstand outsid the govern in the econom chamber and in other institut which show greater skeptic h5 commun with the govern h5 vecer how are your relat with the govern it is said that your stubborn attitud on that specif issu did not find you great sympathi among particular govern minist abov all those directli respons for the economi stanoevski no we have alreadi talk about that about the oppos interest which are known vecer ye but we did not talk about the misunderstand that have been report about interest rate polici last year stanoevski okay we have discuss interest rate the govern adopt some recommend and resolut about interest rate polici which were creat here togeth we estim that the interest rate polici of the commerci bank in the first half of last year wa not set realist the economi rightli rebel against the high interest rate we discuss thi problem at the bank s council and the govern also discuss it at it own special session we came up with ident decis we charg the bank with re examin their interest rate polici vecer you say that the govern discuss the interest rate polici at it session whi should the govern discuss the interest rate polici when it is the respons of the nbm is that not just interfer by meddler stanoevski no the govern discuss it under pressur from the chamber and from a group of econom leader who demand an audienc with the govern otherwis the interest polici of the commerci bank is not within the compet of either the nbm or the govern vecer is it true that the central bank doe not have ani difficulti in carri out the inadequ interest rate polici in the commerci bank without anyon take administr measur against it stanoevski we do not have ani legal basi for such administr measur vecer don t you think that the nbm howev should be abl to regul interest rate polici with administr measur countri like the u s until 1986 or spain until 1987 fix interest rate in the commerci bank use administr mean didn t they stanoevski okay i agre that there should be some measur howev the measur should be base on indirect mean through monetari polici measur in order to cut interest rate and we will tri to do that abov all through auction vecer were you on the same wave length as the govern when it wa a matter of the financi reorgan of the bank especi with respect to the format of an agenc for the financi reorgan of the bank stanoevski here we had a small problem now there is no kind of agreement there were two these we all agre that an agenc for the financi reorgan of the bank should be form as an institut which would be profession charg with that work and not as it ha been up to now by necess debat it wa complet a technic question should all the technic work for the agenc be conduct by the bank what should be meant by that technic and administr work no one defin it such a decis for a particular short period wa use in slovenia but it wa emphas that it should be duplic in our law our opinion wa that it should be an independ govern agenc and in the end our interpret wa accept on the contrari let s say the director of the agenc in a way would also be a director of a detach sector in the central bank i could not accept that with that the independ of a work unit would be statutorili establish have two master on the one hand the council and the govern and on the other a manag council of some agenc it is a good thing that there wa in the end someon who thought that it should remain as it wa vecer wa the law taken out or return in the assembl s procedur stanoevski the law wa not taken from the procedur it wa incorrectli introduc simpli befor the law enter the procedur we agre with the leader of the govern that a controversi articl would be expung moreov bekir zuta incorrectli accept it and transfer it to the ministri not further identifi which took the law out of the procedur when we saw what had been done we immedi correct the error and return the law to the procedur vecer how much do the state reserv amount to current stanoevski at the moment there are about 122 million but that is subject to veri rapid chang with respect to the fact that the oblig to the world bank should now be paid the largest share of the currenc reserv ha been acquir through exchang transact we end 1992 with about 66 million in currenc reserv but now you see they have increas by about 60 million of which 50 million wa deriv from exchang transact but the rest is from abroad actual we sold more abroad through the currenc market than we bought h5 non immun of the polici h5 vecer doe polit interfer with the work of the bank now an elect of three deputi governor is immin saban prevala is a repres of the parti for democrat prosper dusanka hristova is a member of the presid of the liber parti and dr gligor bisev ha been call up to now an independ stanoevski you see befor the end of last year we were left without a deputi governor in accord with my dutie i am charg with suggest the elect of deputi governor and of an act governor consid that for me as governor it wa the presid of the republ who name me and who can dismiss me i first acquaint him with the problem we examin two possibl option the matter could be left until the elect of the next governor or it could be resolv now in order for the peopl to ensur continu and to assum a portion of the governor s duti parliament select them and in the final analysi they are respons to the assembl and not just to me as governor we agre howev that it would be better not to wait for the expir of my term but rather to propos deputi governor vecer we hear that there are some problem with the rule concern their appoint stanoevski well until yesterday until the withdraw of the propos from the agenda i thought that there were no problem of ani kind where thing stand now i have not been inform in the public media i read that thi wa tie to my replac and that the nomin of the new governor and the elect of the new deputi governor should be postpon for a while vecer when will your term expir do you have the right to campaign for a second term stanoevski i cannot campaign for myself it is up to the presid of the republ to offer a nomin my term expir on 19 octob thi year vecer to what extent is there a possibl for you to be governor of the nation bank for a second time stanoevski that would depend upon mani circumst and it is most like that at that time it would be possibl for me to say whether i would be a candid abov all it depend on who will be presid of the republ and what kind of composit the govern will have vecer when your term expir the presid of the republ and the composit of the govern will certainli be the same consid that the elect will probabl be even later stanoevski i do not know whether in the last month of their work the parliamentarian will debat the select of a new governor it is most like that would leav me in place after the expir of my term provid of cours that i wait through the end of the term and anoth few month as act governor consequ if they want to replac me they should do so now vecer in our convers you continu stress if i wait through the end of the term do you realli feel such strong pressur to resign stanoevski no i have experienc absolut no such pressur but recent the press ha begun to write about that vecer and just how much power doe the press have certainli it cannot replac you stanoevski no it certainli won t replac me i trust the press and i trust that you now have exact data and do not fabric thing you probabl know someth now that i do not vecer they say when all kind of stori begin to circul about a certain person in polit life then certainli they are tri to suggest someth to him what is suggest to you by the stori that you have a privat bank stanoevski i have not heard these stori unfortun i do not have ani kind of bank and i do not have even one denar of stock in ani kind of bank my wife is in one bank in the credit bank and probabl that is the ground for the stori for me it is an unfulfil dream to have my own bank but i cannot get the capit sinc i do not have 150 000 mark vecer much earlier you chang the law which strengthen the limit for open save account previous other thing be equal would it have been easier for you to open a save account stanoevski if i made a mistak i made it earlier four or five year ago in the former yugoslavia i should have form a bank then h5 scandal h5 vecer speak about privat bank and save account is it possibl for us to have a scandal along the line of those of dafiment bank or jugoskandik bank stanoevski as far as i know a scandal ha alreadi arisen it concern a save account which call itself a branch of some belgian bank it promis credit up to 60 000 german mark with a hypothet deal with which it collect a lot of resourc from citizen and suddenli disappear anoth case and a much bigger scandal involv the situat with jugomarket stedilnica save bank as a result we made a decis that the licens of that bank should be revok the consequ are known they will not work either as a bank or as a save institut they will go bankrupt and the deposit will be settl by the bankruptci court vecer what s go on with karic bank stanoevski karic bank of belgrad ha a busi branch in skopj which wa in complianc with the provision rule of the law on bank as it then exist but as such it wa not under the control of the nbm i spoke with the owner of karic bank and they were categor that not a singl depositor would lose money either interest or princip i promis them assist and that i would discuss with some of our bank give them denar credit on the basi of the hard currenc deposit and that the nbm would not treat these deposit in accord with the bank s hard currenc polici thu we would make an except in the interest of the citizen vecer to what extent do you work with the bank for foreign trade stanoevski in my opinion the bank for foreign trade ha not carri out the procedur for separ itself from the former jugobanka in the most felicit manner that is whi from the veri begin of it oper it encount liquid problem toward the end of last year the liquid of the bank reach a critic point for pay into the save account of citizen as guarante by the nbm and they began to draw on the resourc of the central bank at that point we issu a rule which prohibit them from use thi money for other purpos while draw the resourc for the save account thi prohibit last onli 15 day later we replac thi rule with anoth one which stipul certain measur to overcom the problem in three month we will decid whether the bank should enter the restructur process vecer have the ambigu regard the busi balanc between komercijalna and stopanska bank been fulli clarifi stanoevski no the busi balanc wa not fulli complet and i think that the entir work should be finish much quicker the two bank should themselv work out a mutual agreement it would be wrong for the komercijalna bank to think that it ha extric itself from thi there will be problem for exampl the stopanska bank could take advantag of some unfair practic the world bank the imf and the other intern financi institut should be inform that the disput between the two bank ha not end vecer and in conclus the competit for new macedonian bank note ha end how far ha work progress stanoevski the competit ha end but the decis on the bid have been review by a special form group which is under the auspic of the nation bank and on which artist scholarli and financi expert collabor in accord with their suggest we agre to make a contract with the win contest biljana unkovska who now live in slovenia she is to prepar six bank note with figur and six bank note with other symbol from our cultur and nation heritag when these are readi we will decid which design to accept
