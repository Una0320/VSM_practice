resettl of the peopl in the 13 counti along the chiang jiang ha alreadi begun i cannot say much about thi project sinc i am not an expert in water conserv and i have been driven out of the countri nevertheless i am quit familiar with the cpc parti cultur of score of year the process from the earli evalu to the final decis in develop the three gorg project precis show a vivid sampl about the influenc of the parti cultur there are mani thing that make peopl indign and heav a deep sigh i would like to inform my fellow countrymen about them in thi articl h5 know the present by review the past h5 dure the 40 year when the communist parti of china rule the countri all parti leader invari love to develop larg project and exagger there are some well known exampl from the mao era such as steel make in backyard overtak britain in 15 year and realiz commun after three year the practic of everyon eat from the same big pot which mean commun wa propos in 1958 also there wa the sanmen gorg water conserv project along the yellow river the parti order the project becaus it want to make the water in the yellow river clear with chairman mao s hand so that the prophesi that when a sage emerg the water in the yellow river becom clear left from the ancient time would be fulfil by chairman mao at that time the whole parti regard the develop of the sanmen gorg dam as a polit task of top prioriti howev the yellow river is still fill with murki water today when the sage ha alreadi been dead for more than 10 year the sanmen gorg clog with silt ha becom a cynic mockeri of the greatest sage in the world fantasi mao s successor hua guofeng realiz that it wa hard for him to exercis leadership becaus he lack polit capit he sought to score more econom achiev to make up for hi polit weak thu he made magnific plan to build ten enterpris such as the baotou iron and steel complex and anoth ten oil field such as the daqe oil field later hi mistak wa seiz by deng xiaop who sneer and call it a foreign leap forward later hua guofeng wa kick out of the polit bureau togeth with hi bold remark the chines communist leader love to talk and act big but not becaus they are conceit or they have the person tempera of love to brag the project they choos to develop are not realli conduc to the nation economi or the peopl s livelihood they are aim at heighten or consolid their polit author thi is the purpos of put polit in command of everyth deng xiaop critic hua guofeng for promot the foreign leap forward but he himself cannot jump out of the eccentr ring of histori if polit leader are elect by the peopl they must pay full attent to the will of the peopl and the tenur of their offic is limit they would not commit such error thi is the first main point of the parti cultur rais a hue and cri on the mass media and win warm applaus from the peopl is half way to success for the chines communist they attach great import to propaganda work they do not take into consider in advanc the difficulti they may encount as well as the consequ deng xiaop s suggest to cross a river by feel the stone is a brief outlin of thi mode of think therefor most of china s project in econom construct have a fine start but poor finish there are some project where a great deal is said but no action is taken in some case they cannot find the stone while in other case they have not got into the water yet the aforement is the second main point of parti cultur in econom construct the three gorg project for hydroelectr power gener wa veto when mao zedong and zhou enlai were in power whi doe thi project resurfac again after 1989 we are abl to understand the situat better if we studi the first and second main point of the parti cultur deng xiaop li peng zou jiahua and other have made the final decis to develop the three gorg project under thi kind of histor background becaus they need to serv the need to put polit in command of everyth as far as 1989 is concern the chines communist leadership regard it as a bad year the 4 june butcheri wa follow by the collaps of the soviet union and eastern europ face with troubl at home and abroad the chines communist found themselv isol and helpless as never befor it wa at such a time that they propos develop the three gorg project on the surfac they claim that power shortag were the roadblock in increas product and deepen reform quot zou jiahua s word but actual the project is aim at set the peopl mind at rest and divert them from their discont with realiti thi mental of sing a grand beij opera for the peopl is similar to that of work hard to host the 2000 olymp game in beij refer to zou jiahua s remark i said at a gather held in the silicon valley near san francisco on 15 august 1992 that the chines communist hope to extric themselv from their predica by develop the chang jiang water conserv project the result will invari be a suicid polici bring calam to the countri and the peopl actual china is not short of electr power power shortag problem can be solv by adopt other measur what china need badli is democraci and human right local newspap have carri report on my speech h5 understand the present to better predict the futur h5 those at the top act arbitrarili and turn a deaf ear to all neg view to meet requir in accord with the second main point of parti cultur it is necessari to mobil the whole parti to ensur that public opinion from the top to the bottom throughout china is in conform with the parti central committe all those with differ polit view are crimin and enemi first of all a leader set up a plan at a meet deng xiaop alway make the final decis then he mobil a group of expert to rig up all the argument to prove the brillianc and correct of the parti central committe there wa a water conserv expert at the qinghua univers professor huang wanli 7806 8001 6849 prior to the develop of the yellow river sanmen gorg dam dure the mao era he wrote a letter to the govern organ in charg of the project to oppos the develop of the project for thi he wa label a rightist and depriv of hi right to speak a campaign wa whip up in the 1990 s to develop the major chang jiang water conserv project huang onc again wrote a letter to voic hi opposit he wa turn down he sought to go through legal proceed against the project natur he wa total ignor anoth water conserv expert wrote a letter suggest build five to six medium hydroelectr power station in differ locat along the tributari of the chang jiang which would be abl to gener electr within five year the greatest advantag of thi project is that all place of histor interest and scenic beauti would remain intact while improv navig along the chang jiang is insur thi plan wa reject by li peng and other who love to talk and act big they held that the disadvantag of the plan is that it cannot solv all the problem at one fell swoop nor can it demonstr the superior of social here we have onc again run into the parti cultur roadblock to ensur uniform in all mass media throughout the countri all newspap and journal are forbidden to print ani opposit view they also are not allow to print letter from reader who question the project when expert and hong kong report conduct on site inspect tour they were invari brief in advanc about the project and the tremend achiev after the complet of the project we cannot but admir the painstak effort made by those who advoc the project they fear that the hong kong news media would differ with the parti central committe in opinion when the 1992 nation peopl s congress npc wa prepar to adopt the motion on the three gorg project a scale model of the project wa put on display outsid of the confer hall and the chines communist leadership whip up a frenzi insid and outsid of the congress for the project they did not expect that one third of the deputi would still vote against the project or abstain thi wa the first time in the histori of the npc that it role as a rubber stamp wa overshadow one of the npc stand committe member huang shunx held a press confer say that there are more disadvantag than advantag in develop the three gorg project he also said that the chines communist offici made him angri by exert pressur on the npc deputi natur newspap did not report on what he had said later the chines communist expel huang shunx from the npc without make him lose hi face from thi we can see that the entir process in the develop of the three gorg project is soak with the poison juic of the parti cultur the parti cultur is a product which combin autocraci with class struggl it sharpli conflict with ani effort to make polici decis with a democrat and scientif approach the three gorg project is one of system engin which goe beyond the centuri a dam with the highest elev of 175 meter in the world falsehood and subjectiv have no place in ani scientif undertak in addit most of the peopl work on the project are laymen or cadr who blindli follow order right now the qualiti of the cadr are much wors than those who built the sanmen gorg dam dure the mao era when a vice minist of water conserv and the chief respons person of the corpor in the develop of the three gorg project assum hi post he said we plan to cut short the time to dam the river by one year so that it will happen at the same time as the return to china of sovereignti over hong kong the year 1997 will be a year of doubl celebr i hope that comrad in the depart carri out preparatori work for the project will work conscienti and boldli even if they make mistak i will natur assum the respons he ad we like to ask a question whi is it necessari to drag togeth the occas of dam the chang jiang and the return of hong kong s sovereignti to china the author in beij are think about recov hong kong ahead of schedul doe thi mean that the date for dam the chang jiang will also be move up so that it will happen in the same year as hong kong s return to china besid peopl in hong kong do not feel that 1997 is a year for celebr in the year of doubl celebr for what do we celebr dure the past dozen of year china had alway select 1 juli or 1 octob to start or finish ani construct project or to launch a new ship as a sign to make contribut to the parti to complet a project or launch a new ship on a certain date worker have been ask to hurri up and work overtim at the sacrific of qualiti as a result such practic often caus landslid major setback and even death i rememb that when the telegraph build in shanghai wa complet in 1987 the leadership chose the parti s birthday to celebr the occas howev worker did not have enough time to instal the elev as a result a custom want to use the elev but got himself kill to fulfil a polit task a joyou occas thu end as a funer in addit local newspap were not allow to report the incid when the aforement offici said that i shall natur assum respons hi tone wa magnanim but actual he would not be held responsibil there are hundr of differ type of work on the work site if worker at the lower level have problem do all of them need to ask the command in chief on the work site to solv them the work site cover an area about dozen of li in diamet if anyth goe wrong in term of qualiti how doe the command in chief at the top know who ha caus all thi as soon as thi anonym person in respons open hi mouth we knew that he wa deepli poison by parti cultur thi kind of person can be an outstand cadr in do polit work but he is definit not a man of action as the respons person for the project thi vice minist mention noth about qualiti first he wa onli respons to li peng and zou jiahua he did not assum respons for the live and properti of million of resid along the chang jiang no wonder disastr thing happen we can predict the futur if we care examin what is happen right now the three gorg project is destin to end up in the follow three disastr way 1 chang for the wors such as ecolog imbal and drop of the groundwat level take place after 10 to 15 year of hydroelectr power gener at the three gorg dam just like the aswan dam which caus mass desertif in the lower reach of the nile river egyptian now regret what they had done in build the dam 2 due to the improp handl of the silt problem the water level in the section of the chang jiang between chongq and yichang will continu to rise just like what happen at the sanmen gorg dam 3 the tragedi caus by the burst of the gouhou dam in qinghai on 27 august which kill more than 400 peopl serv as an advanc warn from god to li peng jiang zemin and zou jiahua that whenev work is not properli done in strict accord with specif in a certain locat in a huge system engin project an irremedi dam burst would occur when torrenti flood come down from the hilli area in late spring and earli summer thi will be a catastroph beyond redempt h3 compatriot are respons for stop the chines communist wanton behavior h3 in one of hi poem mao zedong seem to forese thi catastroph in hi poem kunlun sourc of the chang jiang he wrote in summer day your melt torrent flood the stream and river turn men into fish and turtl who ha pass judgement on the good and ill you have wrought these thousand autumn who are the chief culprit who will caus thi terribl tragedi if these sever futur histor crimin do not wake to realiti by now there will be peopl who compil the list of those who stay condemn through the age obvious a catastroph now loom over the vast land of china while the beij author stubbornli cling to their own stand how can the chines peopl let them act blindli and recklessli all those who are concern over the fate of the motherland should express themselv they should write letter to the nation peopl s congress the cpc central committe and the state council launch a signatur campaign or send appeal to the ministri of water conserv and parti and govern organ to express their view peac they must call for effort to stop develop the project resettl peopl and invit tender abroad becaus thi is a major event which will involv the live and properti of million of peopl and thoroughli destroy our beauti motherland like what happen in the struggl against the four old old idea old cultur old custom and old habit everi compatriot who is concern about china and it peopl is respons for stop the chines communist from act wildli in defianc of the public opinion the chines peopl should not allow the chines communist to do what they pleas and remain silent like what they did dure the cultur revolut
