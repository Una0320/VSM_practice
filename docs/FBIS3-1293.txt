nation congress ha been at the forefront of the struggl to emancip women but that is not where the struggl end on the contrari it is possibl that the struggl is onli now begin in light of the fact that the women s leagu will have to defend itself against game by a new govern thi is what nosiviw mapisa 38 the leagu s secretari gener tell me sit behind a big desk in her offic at anc headquart in johannesburg she is precis and deliber about the futur of women in south africa especi after the 27 april elect our struggl for the right and recognit of women will continu even after the anc ha come to power we will not toler ani unreason or game from a new govern we have a futur vision for all the women of south africa and for that reason we will insist that they have at least a 30 percent represent in the futur govern accord to mapisa it is also a given that the govern of the futur will have to be gender sensit and that women must be abl to make their contribut to the write of a constitut the most import short term object that the women s leagu now ha is to draw up a manifesto of women s right befor the 27 april elect the manifesto must be readi so that it can be put on the tabl when the elector meet after the elect mapisa say that when the anc come to power that will be a victori for mani oppress peopl but that is not where the anc s work end it doe not matter who lead the countri in the futur that govern must also provid for the need of women the govern will have to protect women through legisl and keep them from be vulner as they are now accord to mapisa the women s leagu doe not forese function as a separ organ in the futur there is no longer ani need for a bunch of differ women s organ it is necessari that a singl women s movement be form that can function nation if we realli want to see to it that women in the futur are recogn and notic program will have to be offer on the nation level that is whi it is import that an umbrella organ be form that speak on behalf of all women as far as develop is concern women s educ is high on the women s leagu s agenda rectifi action will be useless in the futur until women are brought up to a level where they can meet the demand made of them there are still mani illiter women in south africa it is to them that we must now reach out so that they too can learn skill that will allow them to contribut to the futur of the countri there is no ambigu within the rank of the women s leagu on the question of common law we are complet oppos to that on principl becaus in the first place it affect onli african women and in the second place it is onli to the detriment of women most of the time the women s leagu even feel that it is it duti to educ those women who are still subject to common law accord to mapisa there are still mani women especi in rural area who do not know what their right as women are and for the rest of their live they will be inferior in the eye of their commun and husband becaus they do not know better there are mani women such as we in the women s leagu who are more enlighten and independ and it is our duti to impress upon women that they have right too we do not intend by thi to destroy all tradit and cultur through our effort on the contrari the door of cultur will in fact be open but the women s leagu believ that cultur and tradit that advers affect women must be question she say the reason for violenc mapisa say is that peopl are final move toward freedom she believ that there are forc that are oppos to the liber process and that are tri to divid the peopl of thi countri despit the violenc howev the leagu s polici is to reach out to all the women of south africa by way of the nation women s coalit we are reach out to inkatha women especi those in natal where the violenc is the worst we believ that the time will come when all the women of the countri will be abl to stand togeth becaus they accept the emerg of a new south africa that mean that it will not
