solar energi heat util technolog h3 china s research and demonstr of solar energi heat util in an organ and guid manner began in the mid 1970 start in the 1980 new energi resourc and renew energi resourc technolog wa includ in the state s attack on key s amp t problem in the sixth 5 year plan seventh 5 year plan and eighth 5 year plan and solar energi heat util technolog is a subtop in new energi resourc and renew energi resourc project start from china s nation strength and real need the focu of attack on key s amp t problem regard solar energi heat util in the sixth 5 year plan and seventh 5 year plan wa place on preferenti develop of low temperatur heat util technolog the actual project were solar energi water heater passiv solar energi save hous solar energi dryer and solar stove through 10 year of effort solar energi heat util technolog in these four realm basic move forward s amp t achiev have shift into small batch product to vari degre and a substanti number have an extens and applic coverag area and have provid real benefit in allevi local shortag of convent energi resourc reduc ecolog and environment degrad and other area accord to incomplet statist for 1991 we have extend 1 8 million squar meter of solar energi water heater 300 000 squar meter structur area of passiv solar energi save hous 330 000 hectar of solar energi agricultur greenhous 120 000 solar stove and 1 314 squar meter of solar energi dryer and we have consist maintain a develop momentum chines made solar energi water heater can conserv an averag of 100 to 150 kg of standard coal per squar meter each year solar stove can conserv 500 to 700 kg of firewood per unit each year h5 c the main problem and impedi that exist at present h5 china lag behind foreign countri in two area in solar energi heat util one is s amp t invest the govern in the unit state invest 500 million annual in solar energi research and develop from the late 1970 to earli 1980 subsequ due to a drop in the price of petroleum and the energi polici of the reagan govern there wa a substanti reduct in expenditur on solar energi research and by the earli 1990 they were consist maintain at the level of 150 to 200 million annual japan s new energi resourc industri technolog comprehens develop organ nedo and global environment industri technolog research organ rite organ scientif research unit and larg enterpris to establish an r amp d group to help acceler the cours of r amp d and commerci thu the develop of solar energi heat util in the develop countri at the present time is character by high s amp t inject especi for breakthrough in new materi r amp d such as light condensor and vacuum tube heat collector use in solar energi thermal power gener station or tower type solar energi boiler which are the result of the commerci of major achiev in modern materi scienc and heat transfer scienc the second area is polici to encourag the extens and develop of solar energi sinc the 1990 the develop countri have univers focus on global environment issu and rais the develop and util of new energi resourc to reduc co sup 2 discharg to an import strateg height and they have concret measur and polici to provid econom subsidi or tax reduct and exempt to new energi resourc thirti one of the state in the unit state have implement energi conserv energi resourc ultim util manag demand side manag plan as part of comprehens resourc plan their method involv state govern encourag public util electr power natur ga and coal ga compani to make everi possibl effort to gener less electr and suppli less ga with a precondit of satisfi user load demand in thi manner compani transfer their invest in power plant capac expans to energi conserv upgrad on the user end which ha the advantag of smaller invest short capit turnov cycl and littl risk now solar energi hot water suppli and solar energi heat are to be includ in construct end manag plan which ha solv problem with the impedi of larg initi invest for solar energi equip and excess heavi user burden it is expect that spur by thi new plan solar energi water heater and solar energi save hous will becom more widespread and develop more quickli h5 iii develop strategi and countermeasur h5 h5 a technolog develop object for differ period h5 china is a develop countri and 800 million of it popul live in vast rural region the energi consum annual to sustain the minimum normal household energi need of our peasant account for 30 percent of china s total energi consumpt within a rather long period to come china s commod energi resourc suppli will be unabl to complet satisfi the basic energi requir of product and life in rural area for thi reason in the near term the next 20 year the develop and util of solar energi heat util technolog in china should still mainli involv low temperatur heat util and be orient toward rural area and medium size and small citi to allevi the shortag of energi resourc there for live and product energi need heat hot water solar energi greenhous etc and improv the situat of ecolog and environment degrad that ha arisen there becaus of energi shortag in the medium and long term 20 to 50 year from now by serv as a program to replac part of the coal we burn we could develop solar energi thermal power gener as appropri and extend energi save type structur center on solar energi heat util in citi h5 b strateg choic for differ region h5 1 in region with categori i solar irradi resourc we can give consider in medium and long term plan to the construct of solar energi thermal power station especi in tibet which is veri poor in coal oil and other convent energi resourc and which ha abund direct radiat sunlight sourc make it uniqu superior econom for the develop of solar energi thermal power gener prior to 2000 we should tri to set up trial point demonstr to enabl further evalu after comparison with photovolta power gener station 2 in region with categori i ii and iii solar irradi resourc we should further extend passiv solar energi save hous and solar energi water heater as a part of structur facil 3 in certain poor region mainli in northwest china there are still place where solar stove can be use but we must pay attent to qualiti improv and implement industri product h5 c suggest countermeasur and measur h5 1 base on the 10 countermeasur and measur that we should adopt in china s environment and develop program propos by the govern move further in formul program for the develop of new energi resourc and renew energi resourc and provid polici focus on provid support in rais capit preferenti treatment in tax collect and other area 2 for major solar energi thermal util project such as solar energi power gener station which have alreadi been commerci intern china should base itself on import advanc technolog and equip from foreign countri in region with abund sunlight such as tibet use feasibl research as a basi for govern invest to invest in their construct avoid the wast caus by small invest and repeat low level scientif research 3 the govern should use industri confer and other mean to organ and reinforc industri manag for solar energi water heater and solar stove product they should mainli do good work on standard and qualiti demonstr system to guarante product qualiti 4 solar energi energi save structur occupi an import statu in structur energi conserv and the ministri of construct should provid unifi deploy and program 5 focu on absorb foreign capit to develop the solar energi product market and rais the qualiti of china s solar energi water heater to modern intern level and make them competit in the intern market
