their activ hope to get support from the budget even in the event of continu with clearli ineffici product everybodi know where thi kind of support lead to new spiral of inflat the slow of the structur overhaul and a drop in econom effici it is precis for thi reason that reform is not progress as quickli as it might at the level of state enterpris in place of the old link of the administr system new administr structur have emerg and strengthen mani of which are by no mean obligatori in market condit although a bureaucrat no longer dole out plan and alloc fund he is no less power

are more intoler in the final analysi we must learn to collect everyth that is due to the state the budget will feel the benefit of such a polici immedi and the budget deficit problem will becom less acut thi is especi import inasmuch as it is becom ever more difficult to resolv thi problem by cut expenditur the govern should put forward legisl initi that envisag shift the center of graviti onto

cost of market transform is not too great for societi we have not manag to achiev thi the high cost of reform is explain first by the unfavor start posit at the end of 1991 the economi wa in an extrem
