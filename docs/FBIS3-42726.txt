the reform are head in the wrong direct h5 4 feb pp 4 5 h5 text h5 onc again the result of shock therapi h5 after 2 year 1992 and 1993 suffici time ha elaps to review the shock therapi and assess it result in give a posit assess of the movement that wa begun toward a market economi we nevertheless must note the continu increas price excess in mani respect which societi ha alreadi paid and which it will be forc to pay for the strategi and tactic chosen for the transit to the market the scale of the current crisi which ha increas as the result of the shock therapi and it intern structur is have an extrem harm effect on the solut of social problem and is fraught with the irrevers destruct of the countri s econom and scientif technic potenti in just the past 2 year the product recess reach about 30 percent in the most import macroeconom indic and compar with the level befor the crisi it came close to 40 percent at the same time it is import to stress that the product recess is not structur but univers in natur first of all and secondli the most advanc and high technolog sector and form of product have been affect to the greatest extent the shock therapi ideologist assess the consequ of the product recess veri superfici they consid it a matter that is temporari and easili redress to make it more convinc they refer to histor experi when the countri regain it former strength in a rel short period of time after tremend destruct and loss as the result of the civil war and world war ii the follow must be mention in thi regard first under current condit the loss of product volum is the loss of the market and not just the world market for exampl in the aerospac industri in arm product and so forth but the domest market as well onc a place in the market is given up it is extrem difficult to regain it second histor analog are not persuas in thi case the time when an economi could be restor with the help of a shovel and a hoe by reli on mass enthusiasm or coercion of the popul ha gone forev thi may be accomplish in the modern world onli with the support of the latest equip technolog and product organ have lost thi capabl the countri is unavoid doom to lag behind for a protract period and perhap perman the socioeconom consequ of the recess in invest activ are the most far reach and danger in just the past 2 year the volum of invest in the russian economi declin by more than one half and today it is about 40 percent of the level befor the crisi with a volum such as thi not onli structur reorgan is imposs but elementari product growth as well but the problem is deeper and more complex even today the depreci of fix product capit ha come close to 60 percent that is to the threshold beyond which physic destruct of the countri s product potenti begin the public ha becom a wit to the increas danger of accid and disast the crisi which is under way ha also affect the field of scienc includ basic and sectori scienc plan and design work and experiment and prototyp product the first rate and world class collect are be disintegr befor our eye the leadership in a number of field of scientif and technic progress is be lost and the physic base is becom hopelessli obsolet the countri is lose it intellectu potenti along with hope for russia s reviv and prosper the collaps of the financi system and the loss of control over the circul of money thi is one of the consequ of the shock therapi polici and the method of implement it we have not manag to normal the budgetari system in 2 year in spite of huge loan from the central bank to cover the deficit and the artifici withdraw from the pension fund the payment crisi result from action that were insuffici consid and the inabl to provid for the normal receipt of tax have onli undermin the incom base of the budget and made for a chronic deficit the govern ha made extens use of the emiss to fulfil it populist declar and as a distinct narcot to reassur product over the past 2 year it ha been the princip borrow of central bank fund the cash emiss increas from 1 5 trillion rubl r in 1992 to r10 1 trillion in 1993 and it proport in the total money suppli grew from 24 to 37 percent and practic all of the cash put into circul over the past year ha remain in the public s hand or is provid for the nonbank turnov of resourc the increas in inflat induc by the liber of price ha not ceas over the 2 year the averag monthli inflat rate in 1993 wa even higher than in the preced year if the januari surg in 1992 is exclud the lack of success in the struggl against inflat can be attribut to misunderstand of it natur in the russian economi underestim of it highli monopol structur disregard for the cost inflat factor and so forth and accordingli by the choic of inadequ and pure monetari mean to hold it in check by demand limit the progress and result of privat are far from ambigu the breakdown of total state control of the economi and the emerg of a grow number of quit energet real properti owner should be includ among it pluse first of all the neg consequ in mani respect stem from insuffici consider of privat itself and the hast to implement it administr pressur and the monotoni of form of privat were maintain orient exclus toward the establish of open joint stock compani and a reliabl legal basi wa not establish the ideologist of privat proclaim that the issuanc of voucher did not provid for it nation natur and that the real depreci of the voucher valu and their concentr in a small number of invest fund wa fraught not onli with further stratif of societi but an increas in social tension the concept of state refus to regul econom and social process ha turn into a gener loss of control world experi in state regul especi in countri with a social orient market economi ha been disregard the special role of the state inher in transit stage of social develop ha not been taken into account the result of carri out a monetarist polici and the state s withdraw from regul of econom and social process as an integr part of it have demonstr the theoret and practic unsound of the cours chosen the exhaust of social resourc to continu the shock therapi is an alarm result of implement thi polici for 2 year the decreas in public incom by more than one half and the sharp increas in their differenti have exacerb the social situat in the countri at present the incom of the 10 percent of the citizen who are most well off are 10 time higher than the incom of those who are the least well off one third of the public have incom below the offici subsist minimum and 10 percent of the popul or about 15 million person are beyond the threshold of physic surviv thi is a warn that the societi is enter a zone of social conflict it must be stress that thi is not simpli a matter of quantit indic over the past 2 year there have been far reach qualit chang and trend have develop which attest to the emerg of a threat to russian societi itself a process of depopul ha begun and the rise mortal rate is attribut to a larg extent to alcohol murder and suicid there is a sharp increas of person in a margin statu and the number of poor homeless alcohol and drug addict is rise the qualiti of human materi is declin at a veri high rate immun to mass diseas is declin and prostitut vener diseas and birth of children with defici are on the increas the public s moral principl social valu and ideal and person and famili hope which alway have made it possibl to surviv temporari advers are collaps it would appear crime is on the increas and becom brazen and mafia group are multipli the briberi extort and embezzl which are becom widespread are not be met by an outcri and moral condemn everyth which ha been state enabl us to maintain that the social price paid by societi for the shock therapi ha exceed the maximum permiss limit the scope of econom and social calam which russia ha endur present a real threat to it nation secur the countri ha found itself at a danger threshold and if it cross the threshold it risk lose the chanc to restor itself as a great power forev thi is the result of 2 year of the shock therapi polici the most radic reform justifi the disrupt and sacrific in everi possibl way as the unavoid cost of a fundament chang in the polit social and econom system that have taken shape and russia s return among the civil countri the econom depart of the ran russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund on the other hand are convinc that no object includ a new version of the bright futur can justifi the social sacrific which the russian peopl have made and to which they are unavoid doom if the chosen cours is continu the differ approach is immor and inhuman the societi which realli exist in russia today is veri remot from the model which exist in countri with a highli effici and social orient market economi to a greater extent it is a societi base on excess develop properti stratif corrupt organ crime and foreign depend from a socioeconom viewpoint thi is not a step ahead but the countri s throwback to 2 centuri ago to an era of primit uncivil capit and ani program to bring russia and it social and econom system up to date can count on success onli if they take into account togeth with world trend it origin the distinct natur of it histori and cultur the spiritu legaci of it peopl and an appropri system of valu russia doe not need to return to world civil it ha alway been part of it and is still part of it as a uniqu type of civil system analysi of the cours of reform and the result of russia s socioeconom develop over the past 2 year make it possibl to draw a number of conclus first the deep crisi and the social problem are not the result of the unresolv problem individu miscalcul or the opposit of conserv forc although all thi had a place but the unavoid consequ of the cours of reform chosen and the method of implement them the attempt to solv all the problem in one leap by a cavalri charg wa dictat not by sober scientif calcul but by impati and polit ambit despit the assert of it initi thi polici ha been and continu to be highli ideal and it is be implement by neobolshevist method second after see the collaps of their chosen cours of econom polici from the first step of it implement the initi of shock therapi did not learn ani lesson but continu to stubbornli insist on it continu thi onli aggrav the situat even more and brought new hardship for the peopl in order to conceal their fiasco the reform in power proceed to engag in systemat misinform of the public and misrepresent of the true situat in the economi and the life of the peopl third from the everi begin there ha been an erron orient toward the decis role play by foreign aid and domest sourc to stimul busi activ especi invest activ have not been put into action it becam clear rather quickli that thi wa a major strateg miscalcul the meager amount of thi continu promis aid cannot serious affect the result of the reform in russia under ani condit howev even after thi no seriou adjust have been made in econom polici fourth the claim of infal and possess of absolut truth lie at the basi of mani of the error commit and the unwilling to chang the cours of econom polici even after it complet failur wa reveal henc the unwilling to listen to critic and the depict of thi critic as allegedli come from the enemi of reform the notion that there is no altern for the reform but the strategi and tactic for implement it chosen by the author of shock therapi are be stubbornli impos on public opinion fifth the unprofession of the initi and champion of the shock therapi polici ha becom obviou by now the public ha encount a new varieti of subjectiv and voluntar in the develop and implement of econom polici and clearli express ideolog attach in the polici itself howev there wa a qualit turn point in the peopl s frame of mind at the end of 1993 in the decemb elect the peopl spoke out decis against the experi associ with shock therapi onli about 8 percent of the voter support the russia s choic bloc whose leader are the ideologist and champion of thi polici continu thi polici even further mean act against the clearli express will of the peopl the econom depart of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund believ that in the name of restor russia as a great power it is essenti to critic and honestli assess the result of the past 2 year and to work out a new strategi of social and econom reform h5 on a new strategi for social and econom reform h5 select of a strategi for socioeconom reform is one of the key question of theoret thought and polit practic and one of the most complic one as well the problem of select itself is base on recognit of the mani variat and altern in social develop world and domest experi ha demonstr the bankruptci of notion about the unequivoc adher to direct of social progress and about the exist of a certain ideal model of a socioeconom system for all countri and peopl choos a strategi for socioeconom reform is a complex state and public process which requir not onli thorough scientif studi but take into account the will of the peopl and the consent of lead public and polit forc and movement certain basic principl in develop such a strategi first defin and formul the social indic of the reform it object as well as the limit which must not be cross under ani circumst for ani reason a guarante subsist minimum an employ threshold a proport of expenditur for educ and public health in the gnp and other factor second reject naiv faith in automat normal of the economi with the aid of deperson monetar and restor state regul in it natur and gener accept function the immedi step in our view are as follow shift the emphasi to support for physic product and stimul of busi activ includ invest activ work out an effect industri polici includ a structur polici to give the russian economi an up to date appear and increas the competit of domest product in the world and domest market and ensur the suprem author of the law and develop well reason and reliabl econom legisl and stabl rule of the game without which the subject of a market economi cannot function success third shift to new principl for financi stabil of the nation economi base on elimin of disproport between the materi substant and financi cost aspect of reproduct fourth set the object of form a singl all russian market as a basi of the reform when the specif natur of the feder system in russia is taken into account thi mean shift the center of graviti to local area in implement econom reform while the center retain the function relat to the format and function of a unifi market develop of unifi rule of the game regul of the circul of money common custom territori and provis for the free movement of good financi resourc and manpow among the region fifth reexamin the role of foreign aid in reform the russian economi use as a basi the strategi of orient toward domest scientif technic and product potenti and domest sourc of save thi doe not conflict with the cours toward open of the economi and russia s limit particip in the world economi but presuppos that it can and should basic resolv it own problem itself sixth a special role is play by the problem of chang properti relationship thi is one of the princip direct for further develop and expans of the econom reform the follow are key approach in the new strategi overcom the ownerless natur of properti and find a real interest and respons owner for each of it form includ the state form gradual movement toward a modern multistructur economi in which the most divers form of ownership are combin and supplement each other privat and state cooper and municip the properti of public and religi organ foreign properti and the variou joint form of it provis for an increas in effici and attract of invest to expand product and modern it should be among the chief criteria when make one decis or anoth about privat consist curtail of voucher privat as a populist direct which is incap of resolv the social justic problem but which increas the growth of inflat and the disorgan of industri potenti and shift the center of graviti from privat of properti to privat of manag as the most import condit for develop the activ of person in a market economi base on these fundament approach a long term state program should be work out to chang properti relationship it cannot be onli the busi of one depart the goskomimushchestvo state committe on the administr of state properti it should be carri out with the particip of all part of the feder execut author subject of the feder organ of local self govern and other nonstat structur pension insur and chariti fund cooper associ and religi organ the econom depart of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund believ that the realiz of all these principl will make it possibl to chang the guidepost of econom reform to expand it social base to minim the social cost and to retain the potenti for revit russia the qualiti of the peopl educ medicin cultur and basic scienc the basic stage of the econom reform achiev of the final object formul abov will requir a long period of time for thi reason it is import to determin the consist and interrelationship of the step be made to have a kind of network schedul of the reform clear cut divis of the stage is also social signific becaus it make the real practic achiev result more specif for the peopl three stage in realiz the new strategi for russian econom reform may be singl out in consolid form the first one the stabil stage will take roughli 2 to 3 year a combin of measur aim at prevent further impoverish of the peopl and the degrad of societi is set forth as an absolut prioriti here in the econom sphere the princip task in thi stage are stop the recess of product and embark on the path of it subsequ upsurg singl out breakthrough zone which make it possibl to break the neg tendenc and achiev visibl social import result hous construct solut of food and medicin problem and so forth stabil of the financi situat and gradual reduct of the rate of inflat bring it to an accept level at thi stage and maintain the potenti of revit and econom growth scientif technic and personnel potenti advanc technolog uniqu research and develop and so forth prioriti in social and invest structur polici the principl of tax money and credit and currenc polici and consolid indic for the budget and the volum of critic import purchas should be determin and adopt with a guarante of their stabil in the veri near futur success implement of task in the stabil period will make it possibl to enter the second stage the stage of major structur and institut reorgan of the economi it may take about 10 year thi time will be requir not onli so that the product volum befor the crisi can be restor but so that structur reorgan of the economi can be carri out and develop of the subject and infrastructur of a market economi can be complet achiev the pre crisi volum in the gnp when the structur ha been renov should make it possibl to substanti improv the level and qualiti of the peopl s life and to smooth out the unwarr gap between group of the popul those with the highest and lowest incom the growth of the size and rel import of the middl class will becom one of the import stabil of the social and polit situat in the countri by the end of thi period we can count on a substanti decreas in russia s depend on foodstuff the activ particip in the foreign market of product from the process industri and full and steadi convert of the rubl perform of the task cite will make it possibl to move to the final stage of the reform complet of a model for a social orient market economi which is adequ for russia s condit and inclus among the leader of the world economi h5 structur polici in the current stage h5 structur polici is essenti a tool for shape the intersectori and intrasectori proport of product and the most import factor which determin the effici of the entir nation economi an effect structur polici is possibl onli when definit prerequisit are observ they includ determin of clearli outlin and formul structur object favor condit for invest activ and the avail of mechan and institut for the realiz of nation prioriti these prerequisit are practic nonexist at present in thi sens there is everi reason to maintain that the condit were not creat over the 2 year of reform for conduct a purpos structur polici the action taken by the govern to resolv the vast number of privat problem in the area of product and invest activ do not exceed the limit of current practic regul of the economi at the same time the structur of the economi is chang spontan and a number of neg trend have taken shape today they includ the follow a faster product recess in the process sector which determin the level of qualiti of the technolog be use for exampl reduct of electr engin output and instrument make product over the 2 year by 42 percent and a cutback of 40 to 48 percent in the product of organ synthesi an increas in stress on the economi s structur becaus of the increas proport of energi raw materi sector a substanti and continu increas in the power output ratio of the nation economi 15 percent in 1992 and 5 percent in 1993 an increas in the proport of gross output of secondari product and reserv it increas by over 10 percentag point over the 2 year period a sharp decreas in the volum of capit invest by more than one half and as a result a substanti acceler of the age process of the product machineri and an increas in the conceal retir of capac as of the end of 1993 the depreci of fix product capit wa assess at 58 percent and the level of conceal retir of capac by sector wa 10 to 15 percent and the high rate of declin in the product of popular food commod which ensur qualiti in the diet by 43 percent in the product of meat and dairi product over the 2 year period in the opinion of the econom depart of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund all the trend cite attest to the rapid format of an orient toward raw materi in the russian economi and the loss of a signific part of it scientif and technic potenti under condit in which a domin role in inflationari process is play by cost inflat it is imposs to combat it success by pure moetarist method moreov in such a situat the anti inflationari measur aim at limit the money suppli and reduc the budget deficit depriv the entir nation economi of the opportun to make effici structur chang and lead to intensif of the product recess the lack of invest doe not make it possibl to chang the structur of technolog and therebi stop the cost inflat under these condit onli after chang the relationship of price to basic product and resourc and make the structur of domest price more appropri for the structur of cost and the structur of the technolog which we have can the macroeconom prerequisit be creat for save and expand invest activ the normal function of product and an effect structur polici accomplish thi task by further price liber chiefli for energi resourc when the monopoli posit of the main commod produc is maintain will constrict the market even further and lead to a new upsurg in inflat further product recess and the collaps of entir sector the economi will be pressur by a new level of price and the price relationship will turn out to be inappropri for effici structur reorgan a differ path is more feasibl use of the tradit stabil measur appli in mani countri in similar situat thi mean the use of state price regul method in a given stage for those commod which increas nation econom cost to the greatest extent at the same time it is import to note two circumst first regul of price is not a repetit of previou method of econom oper even if the state resort to it quit extens at present unfortun not within the system and purpos often under the influenc of the lobbi interest of individu group without coordin with budgetari credit and invest polici separ from the dynam of incom second the method be propos for creat prerequisit for a normal reproduct process is object veri complic to implement it will inevit requir substanti effort from the state those engag in econom activ and labor collect but under the present condit in our view there is no other sensibl altern to it other variat by increas the price of stabil immeasur may end up with a complet econom collaps the model we propos assum the follow sequenc of action price for a limit group of raw materi resourc and railroad tariff are fix for a definit period of time the state liquid it indebted to the sector and sphere of the nation economi and after that the relationship of price and the wage level are normal by mean of the conciliatori process within the framework of thi group the problem of index wage in sector subject to price regul may be resolv by use special wage regul fund form either with tax receipt from abov norm profit or direct budgetari subsidi accord to calcul by the institut of nation econom forecast of the russian academi of scienc made on the basi of appropri model the overal rate of inflat as the result of such measur may be reduc to 8 to 10 percent per month over thi period 2 to 3 month the price in other sector move closer to the norm relationship for the produc sell their product at free price progress taxat is introduc for abov norm profit sanction for evad the tax are toughen there is revalu of fix capit or index of amort allot with tougher condit for their use tax exempt are introduc for part of the profit be use for accumul of fix capit as a result of all the measur be propos the level of inflat may be reduc to 3 to 5 percent per month in 4 to 5 month probabl other method of regul price and stop inflat are possibl as well in the event that the concept of regul itself is adopt the scientist and specialist of the econom depart of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund are prepar to take part in develop a mechan for it implement but at the same time it should be rememb that disregard the problem of price in the nation economi and postpon it solut is fraught with veri seriou consequ which may turn out to be irrevers time dictat the necess of rais thi problem and search for a solut without delay there is no question that the procedur for adjust price to effici relationship is extrem complic it requir veri painstak and skill work when effici price relationship are work out it is essenti to bear in mind that the world correl are not suitabl for us now but the relationship of pre reform 1990 are not satisfactori either inasmuch as they will be play a protect role with respect to obsolet technolog it appear that a balanc between the stimul role of price proport and the rel financi prosper of most of industri is provid by the relationship of price found between the current correl and those of 1990 so the plan is to first establish a certain effici correl of price with the aid of a definit select includ administr measur and then add on the entir system of econom regul to these correl over sever month in addit the psycholog factor play an extraordinarili import role a step such as thi relat to the regul of some price is a kind of signal to all person in the market that the state is take the game to itself and is prepar to deliber and purpos shape the key cost and price proport for a definit period of time the chang in price proport be propos and the avail of signific unutil capac in our economi are still not suffici condit for stabil product and start the movement toward growth in order to reach thi goal an entir packag of measur will need to be implement includ the follow support for the solvenc of sector and enterpris measur such as state purchas guarante for credit to acquir product confirm of resourc for extens of credit and the like may be util here allevi of resourc limit mean the sharp increas in import compon of invest in a number of resourc produc sector as well as the increas in import of certain key product such as cotton manganes and bauxit creation of an econom environ which stimul domest product the creation of such an environ may remov the resourc limit themselv to a signific extent in a number of case with the aid of financi monetari and tax mechan and a chang in the principl of privat and administr measur and state support for larg scale invest and those that are under way in the extract sector and agricultur in the initi stage the defens industri convers should play a decis role in rais the technic level and restor product volum the convers of vpk militari industri complex enterpris accomplish thu far on one hand ha meant imposit from abov to use product potenti to turn out civilian product orient toward the system of manag and direct distribut of resourc that ha taken shape and on the other hand it ha consist of product reorgan from below with orient toward the technolog special which ha taken shape thi approach ha led to preserv of the econom legal and inform isol of the militari industri complex and specif technolog of the vpk often have not been built into the exist technolog line and infrastructur of civilian product under current condit we should not speak about the firsthand use of of technolog avail in the defens complex but the convers of econom resourc concentr in it thi mean the human capit highli skill personnel with habit of technolog disciplin the potenti of niokr scientif research and experiment design work and the transport power engin and social infrastructur the econom resourc of the defens sector are adequ to meet most of the requir for equip of the fuel and power and other civilian sector in rel short period of time consequ the main object of nation convers should becom technic reequip of civilian machin build and increas it capac by chang the special of defens enterpris and bring the product machineri of the main sector of the economi up to date on thi basi the nation natur of the convers should creat the prerequisit so that the result of the convers s effort is not the output of isol type of equip but entir system of machineri nation convers measur on a larg scale are need so that the defens complex s potenti can

problem of defin the long rang goal of structur polici befor the begin of the currrent reform when the economi wa rel stabl and control the main object of structur polici were as follow expans of the consum sector of the economi and increas the public s incent to work and reduc the resourc consumpt of the nation economi on thi basi the technolog level of the variou sector of the economi to reduc the outlay of resourc and improv the qualiti of the end product reduct of the invest burden by redistribut capit invest in the consum sector and increas the scale at which the ineffici part of fund are withdrawn and link up defens machin build through the convers with the task of structur reorgan of the nation economi not one of these task wa carri out at the same time they all continu to be import as they were befor but the method of implement them are be chang substanti now the main factor is that the state is not in a posit to carri out such larg scale task independ condit must be creat for the display of initi and self organ not onli by enterpris under all form of ownership but financi and credit institut the variou fund and broad section of the public itself a nation socioeconom program which would show the real goal and resourc in increas nation welfar can be an import factor here substanti financi accumul by the public should becom an indispens condit in realiz thi program an essenti and immedi step toward thi is the return of those save which our citizen essenti lost when price were liber let us stress again that solut of one of the fundament problem in the reform the problem of structur reorgan of the economi ha been drag out without justif it ha been postpon and made more complic by the financi crisi and the uncontrol product recess problem of an extraordinari natur the attempt to maintain product and technolog potenti have overshadow the strateg goal of the reform in the area of structur polici as a result neither the problem of an extraordinari natur nor the strateg task of structur chang have been resolv favor moreov the breakdown of product potenti creat the danger that the resourc which provid the opportun for extens structur reform may be irretriev lost h5 the cours of agrarian reform and it prospect h5 in the agrarian sector of the economi an extraordinarili tens situat ha taken shape which cannot be assess unequivoc in analyz world and domest experi the econom depart of the russian academi of scienc and the intern reforma fund believ that the transit from one system of econom oper to anoth requir a rel long period of time especi in agricultur thi transit must includ a preparatori period first of all and secondli a transit period the result of 2 year attest to the advers effect of improvis solut and dictat the necess of work out a clear cut concept for implement agrarian reform with the obligatori separ of prioriti and secondari task feder and region task and immedi and long term task as well as the stage for their realiz despit the numer decis made by the govern we still do not have a complet program for develop of the agrarian sector even for the next few year as a result the agrarian reform which had the immedi object of bring agricultur out of the crisi situat ha even aggrav the crisi in a number of way the consumpt of miner fertil ha decreas by roughli one half as much all the indic of product in livestock rais have declin some of the pedigre stock farm have been elimin and select is declin in seed grow the dispar in price for agricultur and industri product is becom acut the gap between them nearli doubl in 1992 capit invest for the entir rang of work in the apk agroindustri complex declin in the 1992 1993 period by 69 percent compar with 1991 the gross output of the complex declin by 21 percent and the product of foodstuff wa reduc by 27 percent the period of time for stabil and recoveri from the agrarian crisi are difficult to predict becaus of the numer factor which affect the statu of the agrarian sector and their differ behavior recoveri from it may be difficult and lengthi for exampl thi mean deal with the mani year of land deteriori the harm ecolog

predomin in the govern s foreign econom polici the cutback in foreign trade turnov took place at an even faster pace than the product recess the total volum of foreign trade turnov in 1992 wa 76 billion and it wa reduc by 24 percent compar with the previou year in 1993 the volum of foreign trade turnov wa r76 2 billion sic that is it remain at the level of the previou year as a whole thi doe not chang the unfavor trend that have taken shape in foreign trade the result cite could have been assess as favor if it had not been achiev by substanti increas the physic amount of commod be export primarili energi resourc when there wa a declin of 15 percent in contract price for them but the main point is that just as in 1992 the composit of export and import becam substanti wors in 1993 export are be deindustri more and more becaus of the deep crisi in the process industri primarili in machin build the composit of import is also take a notic turn for the wors the polici of attract foreign invest which could have had a signific effect in promot invest activ in the economi if it had been success prove to be underproduct as well accord to certain data the total volum of foreign invest in russia wa about r7 billion as of 1 juli 1993 thi is an extrem small amount the currenc polici prove to be ineffect dure the reform acceler introduct of rubl convert wa it key compon it brought definit extern chang into the economi of cours the process of buy and sell foreign currenc by both legal and physic person wa simplifi and experi in the currenc market and exchang is be

and cultiv insecur in the public conscious about the nation currenc and avoid of it in perspect if the govern s currenc polici is not revis all these harm consequ for the economi will not onli be retain but intensifi and final in assess the foreign econom aspect of the russian reform we cannot limit thi sphere to distant foreign countri after the collaps of the ussr the countri of the near abroad are now russia s main foreign market with a concentr of about 60 percent of it total foreign trade turnov and it is veri import that thi is a market where it product are competit howev thi is a more unstabl and less regul market in which price payment and settlement and other instrument for it regul still differ from those accept in world practic as a result there is a continu cutback in mutual tie which is one of the main reason for the product recess in everi one of the new state without except commod exchang within just the ci declin by nearli one half in 1992 compar with the previou year thi trend continu in 1993 a threaten shortsight reorient of russian export from countri of the near abroad to more distant countri is under way thi is shown particularli clearli in the

without the transit of turkmen ga similar process are be observ in the export polici of other ci countri especi turkmenistan kazakhstan uzbekistan ukrain and belaru which may turn into heavi loss of market for russian industri primarili it process sector there is no altern but to reintegr the economi of the ci countri in our view thi is in russia s interest as well as those of the ci countri recognit of thi object necess wa express in the ci countri declar on establish of the econom union howev the extens polit activ display in thi direct will not have real econom result unless a realist and balanc program of practic action is place under thi document there is no such program at present primari attent in draft it should be devot to solut of the follow question in our view first substanti for a model of an open economi as appli to the specif characterist of russia and it new geopolit posit and most importantli determin of the strategi and tactic for reach the goal set by stage the question of develop the process of the open of russia s economi by stage is import and fundament shock method as well as attempt to restor strict administr measur appli under the influenc of transitori interest should be exclud in all stage in actual polici at the same time and thi is import to stress foreign econom polici should have it own constant social compon in all the stage second the question of open and econom secur under the new market condit thi question is much more complic and cover a much broader scale than befor obvious the object now is to protect insur russia s entir reproduct mechan from possibl unfavor influenc of world market condit and to ensur that activ in the russian market by domest and foreign econom entiti conform to overal state interest third a key question in foreign econom polici ha been and continu to be the develop of export and reinforc of their foundat in the strateg plan export polici should be aim at sell commod in the foreign market when the countri ha intern advantag at bring out domest enterpris for competit with foreign firm and at increas the seri product scale of domest output in order to push it out into foreign market it is obviou howev that select of a futur export basket and the industri of export cannot proceed spontan it is equal import that we not postpon creation of a modern mechan of state support for export export credit guarante risk insur and incent for russian invest abroad includ those base on the sale of debt asset which will be abl to form a basi for the countri s particip in intern product and the infrastructur to move domest product into foreign market on a practic level it is necessari to further liber export minim the applic of quota and licens and greatli simplifi the licens procedur thi is especi import for those commod which are not sold in a reduc domest market in the near futur we must sharpli limit the fiscal function of export export duti which is total inappropri for them and later on to the extent that there is a chang in the level and structur of domest price it should be complet elimin final it is essenti to put the export themselv in order organiz and elimin the element of unprofession anarchi and competit between russian firm fourth the import polici need to be fundament revis at the strateg level import polici should be aim at suppli the countri with product which provid technic and econom advantag over domest product which modern the product potenti which enrich the suppli of consum good in the domest market and which suppli us with product which are not turn out in the countri for the purpos of stabil it appear to be absolut necessari to maintain critic central import for state need medicin food and complet unit for the near futur h5 5 feb p 3 h5 text the main practic task is to creat a system of import tariff regul that ha been reason out thoroughli which perform a threefold function optim of import regul of competit and provis for budgetari interest for thi the govern need to be absolut clear about which vital import sector of the economi must be protect which area of foreign competit should be regul and where it should be complet open to stimul the competit of domest product fifth the nucleu of the new currenc polici ha been and continu to be achiev of real rubl convert in principl the accomplish of thi task cannot lead to ani object or doubt but it cannot and should not be done separ but on the basi of stabil of the economi and the state s financ and balanc of payment not all at onc but in stage for thi reason in recogn that the cours toward achiev of real rubl convert is strateg we believ that in the period under review the problem doe not mean artifici acceler thi process but put in order the system of domest rubl convert which is now be speed up as a stage in the transit to it real convert exchang rate format and the establish of effici currenc relationship between the state and jurid and physic person is the central problem here we are proceed from the convict that there can be no direct return to the currenc monopoli of the past and artifici isol of the rubl s exchang rate from the market howev it is absolut essenti to limit the destruct effect of stock exchang specul on the exchang rate and to put the mechan for set the exchang rate in good order on a practic level the follow altern for a solut may be consid here the essenc of the first altern is to introduc 100 percent of the compulsori sale of currenc earn in the market thi is an old idea but it will not produc the desir effect under current condit the essenc of the second altern which we consid prefer in thi stage is to temporarili refus to recogn the stock exchang s rate of exchang for the rubl as the offici rate the central bank of the russian feder could determin the offici rate of exchang in the indic of the actual price proport of russian export and import and use thi as the account rate in all area cover by state currenc regul in calcul tax custom duti and fee in determin the rubl cost of central import in evalu fix capit and foreign invest and final in reflect the foreign currenc which bank and enterpris report in their account and the particip by foreign in privat such an offici exchang rate could be adjust regularli depend on the exchang rate of foreign currenc be held to which it would be expedi to attach the dynam of domest price for good and servic as well real support for the offici exchang rate and expans of stock exchang trade in currenc would be a chang in the current system of currenc central name substitut of the compulsori sale of 50 percent of export earn by a currenc tax of 15 to 20 percent on it leav the remain currenc at the export dispos in perspect both exchang rate will draw togeth to the extent that an authent currenc market is develop and condit will therebi appear for the use of a singl real market rate of exchang offici quot by the tsbr central bank of russia and the shift to a system of 100 percent currenc sale the version be propos remov or limit all the harm consequ of the convert analyz abov sixth the polici of attract foreign invest requir drastic revis the accent here should be on attract privat foreign invest as one of the strateg direct of russia s foreign econom polici in the forese futur foreign privat capit bring in advanc technolog and modern manag it expand the capit accumul and it contribut to develop of the export base and import replac without increas the state s foreign debt in the process which is extrem import under current condit seventh question of foreign indebted and the use of russia s foreign debt asset the accumul foreign debt weigh heavili on russia s foreign econom relat howev the specif natur of russia is that it is a major intern creditor at the same time it is highli unlik that both of these debt can be settl by tradit method it ha becom necessari to adopt nonstandard form of settl the countri s liabil and realiz it debt asset take world practic into account thi problem may be resolv in the follow way repay of the debt by payment of coordin compens with a discount from the nomin amount convers of the debt into invest in it economi or the debtor s economi the sale of debt asset liabil in a secondari market and reciproc credit for liabil the possibl of larg scale reciproc credit for russia s debt liabil and asset may be consid with the particip of the intern monetari fund and the pari and london club eighth the problem of relationship between the feder and the region in foreign econom matter is a sore point there are still quit a number of area in disput here the most import way to put thi entir system in good order first of all is by simplifi it central regul as sensibl as possibl and free it of unnecessari red tape which would automat remov the question of shift a number of farfetch regulatori function to subject of the feder at the structur level when there is a unifi foreign econom polici the feder s subject could have the opportun at their level to choos a sound export import special for a region develop a foreign econom infrastructur and attract foreign invest provid investor with local benefit within the limit of their compet togeth with thi feder subject should have their own market commod to export for region need their own currenc reserv includ those for social purpos and receiv a definit share of the feder incom from foreign trade origin in their territori ninth the cours toward reintegr of the former union republ and format of an

own stage and possibl it ebb and flow solut of the question of the ci countri settlement and payment relationship is most import among the urgent practic task all the attempt or their semblanc to form rubl zone of variou type have fail there is littl hope that the differ attach to the russian rubl by one or two state will be effect in the current stage a realist and reliabl path is to form a payment union of ci countri on a multicurr basi base on the nation currenc of the ci state immedi solut of the follow matter is requir for thi the principl and procedur for coordin the exchang rate of nation currenc the procedur for equal the balanc of account between the countri bank and reciproc convert of nation currenc and the use of one of them the rubl as a collect payment and reserv capit a matter of no less import is the presenc of a stage preced a complet payment union name a clear union whose oper should be entrust to the interst bank of the ci which ha been establish h5 the restor of

it is be carri out not onli without the use of the social shock absorb need in the situat that ha taken shape but without a forecast of the social consequ beforehand as a result the advers trend observ in the social sphere in the past have been intensifi notic sinc the begin of the reform becom veri detriment in natur the natur reproduct of the popul is character by an intens increas in the mortal rate and a declin in life expect thi indic which is one of the integr indic of social process began to drop sharpli in the earli 1990 s it wa 67 5 year in 1980 69 2 in 1990 69 0 in 1991 67 9 in 1992 and 66 0 year in 1993 judg by thi indic the societi appear to have been set back 15 to 20 year that is to the begin of the 1970 s and the princip factor in thi process ha been the steadili rise mortal rate of the peopl in all age group the unfavor age structur of the popul from the standpoint of marriag and the birth rate as well as defer birth becaus of the difficult socioeconom situat ha led to a declin in the birth rate that is unprecedentedli low for russia and a sharp decreas in the total number of birth the effect of depopul ha increas sinc the end of 1991 express in the natur decreas in the countri s popul which is not cover by the increas in migrat while in 1991 russia had a popul of 148 5 million there were 148 3 million perman resid as of the end of 1992 and 147 9 million in 1993 the natur loss wa 219 000 person in 1992 but 806 000 in 1993 that is over three time as mani the scale of the increas in the mortal rate especi for reason of a direct social natur is creat justifi concern with stabil and even some declin in russia s popul 1 653 million person die in 1990 1 69 million in 1991 1 807 million in 1992 and 2 16 million die in 1993 the proport of the total number of death from unnatur caus after 1990 rose from 12 to 15 percent a rapid increas in the mortal rate result from the increas in alcohol nervou stress suicid and murder due to crime in 1993 alon 10 time as mani person die from alcohol poison murder and suicid than dure the 11 year of war in afghanistan unnatur caus led to the death of everi third person of abl bodi age the scale of the mortal rate from these caus is an indisput indic of the societi s ill social health one of the import reason for the neg chang in the dynam of the mortal rate is the unfavor ecolog situat in 1993 the content of pollut in the atmospher in 20 russian citi wa 10 time or more abov the norm extrem high pollut of reservoir exceed the maximum permiss norm by 100 or more time ha been observ in sverdlovsk perm chelyabinsk murmansk orenburg kemerovo and kaliningrad oblast accord to avail estim 15 to 20 percent of the prematur mortal is the result of chronic ill caus by environment pollut now the centripet migrat flow into russia from former republ of the ussr have intensifi sharpli the most critic socio demograph problem is the problem of refuge and those who have been forc to resettl look for asylum in russia becaus ethnic conflict have intensifi in place where they use to live over the past 4 year the number of russian speak refuge ha reach 2 4 million and 2 million person have been forc to resettl in russia as of 1 septemb 1993 352 600 refuge and person forc to resettl were regist in russia which is 6 1 time as mani as in septemb 1992 thi mean an increas in the rate of resettl and the overal potenti for migrat in the next 2 to 3 year until 1995 is estim at 4 million to 5 million person the signific scale of unregul migrant flow is make it difficult to provid the popul with food hous and servic and exacerb the unemploy problem the process of increas unemploy is continu in the countri offici figur in russia as a whole have not exceed 1 percent of the activ popul although it is 7 to 11 percent in individu region hidden unemploy in the form of part time employ and compulsori unpaid leav is typic in the first 6 month of 1993 over 4 million person includ 3 million on compulsori leav without pay were work part time it is estim that 7 000 to 9 000 person or 8 to 11 percent of the abl bodi popul are in the hidden employ categori the growth of unemploy is continu in a stagnant form the proport of person forc to be unemploy for more than 4 month wa 8 percent at the end of 1992 but 52 percent of the total number of unemploy at the end of 1993 the labor safeti situat is get wors about 30 person are kill and more than 50 are crippl in product everi day there are about 400 000 accid each year at enterpris the level of industri injuri is two to four time higher than the correspond indic in the develop countri of europ the increas in inflat and poor wage protect have led to the point that the wage per employe in late 1993 octob wa onli one third of what it wa in decemb 1991 in compar price a similar pictur is typic for the dynam of the public s per capita monetari incom the situat with respect to a minimum pension is even wors in octob 1993 it wa onli one fourth of the minimum in decemb 1991 the trend in the dynam of basic allow for children are similar their correl with averag per capita incom in mid 1993 drop by more than one third 3 3 to 3 7 today s standard for consumpt of food product for most middl incom famili is at the level typic for the late 1960 s and earli 1970 s accord to estim the level of meat and meat product consumpt wa 77 percent of the 1975 level the level of milk and dairi product consumpt wa 72 percent of the 1975 level and the level of consumpt of fish and fish product wa 75 percent of that level in 1993 while the proport of expens for food in a famili s total expenditur wa about 30 percent in 1990 it ha climb to 60 to 70 percent on averag today for one third of the popul who are live on the threshold of poverti thi proport ha reach 90 percent of consum expens and it ha depriv them of the opportun to meet even the most basic need for cloth or to obtain the simplest item and household articl in the subsist minimum of pension food make up 83 percent and nonfood item mainli essenti item for health hygien and medicin make up onli 10 percent most disabl person can obtain onli bread groat and macaroni product but there is a sizabl number of pension 13 to 16 percent who find it veri difficult to obtain even bread and groat if their situat is not chang we can expect an increas in the mortal rate of thi group while most of the popul seem to have been thrown back 20 year as far as current consumpt is concern a small group of famili about 10 percent have seen their incom increas accord to offici data the correl of the averag incom of 10 percent of the richest and 10 percent of the poorest chang as follow it wa 5 4 time in 1991 7 2 time in june 1992 9 0 in june 1993 and 10 4 time in decemb 1993 accord to estim of the institut of socioeconom problem of the russian academi of scienc the proport of poor person with an incom below the subsist minimum is 35 percent but the proport of destitut person with an incom below half of the subsist minimum is 7 to 10 percent we cannot help but note a number of factor relat to the misinform given to the govern and the peopl about the sociodemograph situat that ha taken shape thi primarili concern the dynam of real wage and real incom the center for market condit attach to the russian feder govern maintain that the popul s real incom are increas in thi case a number of method are use one of which is to neglect all the preced period and compar all the subsequ period with januari 1992 which wa the month when wage drop by one third and per capita incom wa one fourth of the previou level anoth method with which they attempt to show the increas in peopl s incom in comparison with 1991 is base on use of the specul and constantli chang exchang rate of the dollar the process of societi s stratif is character by extrem unfavor manifest the extrem intens at which it is proceed which in itself is a neg factor which affect social process and lead to social and psycholog stress the proport of impoverish person and margin strata is increas and the proport of rich person remain rel stabl but the extent of their wealth is increas which aggrav the conflict between the pole there is a common tendenc of incom polar in the wage of social skill group of employe wash away the intermedi group and incom gap are form mainli as the result of more poverti and pauper of a rel broad sector of the popul measur of social support implement dure the reform year do not repres a unifi well consid system payment from the state budget are consist late
