under the rubric vista 94 transrapid ha now made the breakthrough to worldwid market technolog and transport repres for germani as an industri base for high speed maglev railway head han g raschbichl success is also an indic of engin forc first paragraph is vdi nachrichten s introduct text duesseldorf 24 dec 93 vdi n with the govern s affirm decis to build the transrapid high speed maglev railway a decis wa made that reach far into the futur in term of transport and environment polici han georg raschbichl chief manag execut of berlin hamburg high speed maglev railway limit liabil compani take thi view in the follow articl thi graduat engin is absolut certain that transrapid will revolution our transport system the feder govern s decis of 8 decemb 1993 to implement the berlin hamburg high speed maglev railway clear the way for the first applic of maglev railway technolog in germani thi decis is not just the prelud to a new era of environment compat and industri trend set rail transport it is at the same time proof of german industri s innov strength and thi appli both to the no contact and no wear technolog that ha for the first time overcom the limit of wheel and track and to the financ plan work out by industri and the bank as with mani project of the centuri it wa the creativ and commit of engin that set the cours toward the futur if in 1835 it wa the first railroad that began it triumphant march as a new transport repres on the nuremberg to furth line so at the begin of the 21st centuri it will be the high speed maglev railway that revolution our transport system henc in term of transport and industri polici recent a decis wa made that reach far into the futur it all began with emsland graduat engin hermann kemper who wa annoy by the nois caus by the railroad go by hi hous hi idea wa to replac the railway s wheel with electromagnet he knew that magnet forc can assum the carri and guid function of the wheel and track and thu enabl no contact levit with high speed and low nois gener hi reich patent from the year 1934 for a levit railway with wheelless vehicl that by mean of magnet field are guid levit along iron track drp german reich patent 64 33 16 wa more than the vision of a young engin who wa ahead of hi time for the possibl in electron and vehicl construct were still veri limit at that time consequ the implement of hi idea wa limit in 1966 engin took up anew the technolog possibl of thi idea and test it technic feasibl but they also in particular correctli judg it import in term of transport polici the result of the high capac high speed railway studi complet in 1971 were so posit that the develop work begun soon led to the first experiment vehicl have quit differ design as a young engin i began my work on the develop of the high speed maglev railway in the middl of the sixti we my comrad in arm and i were then consciou of the awaken in a new era of railway technolog in which germani had play a lead role all along a pilot system have a new design the so call long stator maglev railway technolog wa abl to be put into oper success in kassel as a result of a joint effort begun in 1974 with professor weh of braunschweig technic univers in thi design the motor is not locat in the vehicl as usual but in the railway becaus of thi the highli problemat transmiss of power through current collector at high travel speed wa abl to be avoid in addit the result wa an especi lightweight and simpl vehicl the variou develop direct thu far were assess in 1977 in a sweep system decis of the feder ministri for research and technolog it wa decid to focu further work on the long stator maglev railway technolog thu we had put through our design as the main develop direct then in 1979 came the first larg scale applic on a just under 1 km long line on the occas of the intern transport exhibit in hamburg ite 79 the govern licens for passeng transport wa abl to be obtain for the vehicl alreadi then fifti thousand visitor were transport in schedul servic with reliabl alreadi veri high for the state of develop then the success in hamburg wa also decis for the construct of the pilot system uniqu in the world for railway system the emsland transrapid pilot system tve so railway histori ha been written sinc 1984 in north germani between lathen and dorpen the transrapid high speed maglev railway ha proven it everyday use in continu servic with a run capac of more than 160 000 km and a world record speed of 450 km h it readi for use wa certifi at the end of 1991 after comprehens test and assess by the german feder railway and lead univers institut thi wa also proof of german industri s lead role in a high technolog that ha now made the breakthrough to worldwid market in addit to it use for a new transport repres especi after the affirm decis for berlin to hamburg when i sum up person today after work nearli 30 year in high speed maglev railway develop i come to the conclus that it wa decis for success that we the engin compani and politician steadili kept up our common commit over so long a time in spite of often seriou obstacl and setback onli becaus of thi is it possibl now that a particularli attract and environment compat transport system will open it servic between the two largest german citi berlin and hamburg at the begin of the new millennium then transrapid train will transport over 40 000 passeng a day everi 10 minut comfort and safe over the 284 km long distanc with travel time of less than an hour also a prerequisit for thi is the plan which is no less innov adopt by the feder govern for the financ and privat sector oper of the berlin hamburg high speed maglev railway it goe far beyond the practic thu far in transport invest and is without preced nation and intern for exampl the oper compani that will oper the high speed maglev railway will be privat financ for the first time furthermor the financ propos also provid for a high degre of take the burden off the feder govern in financ of the railway i am convinc that the implement of the berlin hamburg high speed maglev railway through the joint initi of the feder govern the state take part and german industri will be a sign visibl worldwid of the achiev and innov strength of germani as a technolog and industri base it will prove strikingli the creativ and forc of engin who with the high speed maglev railway have also continu a part of the tradit show them to be pioneer of progress
