obtain highli valuabl technic materi and a readi sale market thi group of factor link to the soviet union s loss of the cold war and to the consider shift in the geopolit balanc in the west s favor could be term a group of purpos chang sinc it is the result of a deliber polici pursu by the develop countri throughout the postwar era thi polici in turn undoubtedli ha it histor root in the west s centuri old militari econom and ideolog practic of contain the russian threat thi tradit meant that the russian state should follow their nation interest it would be logic and entir justifi today if the new russian militari doctrin stipul that it arm forc had the capabl to counter new militari threat on the contin the purpos chang factor by no mean exhaust the result of the global chang of recent year the most power side effect of the weaken of the histor russian power center ha been the control growth in region threat which are now cast doubt on the abil of the cold war winner to respond appropri and are threaten to nullifi all the strateg advantag won by the west dure the soviet perestroyka era quit recent u s defens secretari le aspin admit at a press confer that the end of the cold

principl do not work under the new condit of univers region instabl and the pentagon ha been forc to urgent revis the concept for the use of it strateg nuclear forc sinc under the new condit thi concept ha becom virtual meaningless no open quotat mark as publish we are all face one common problem today grow global discord zbigniew brzezinski the former u s nation secur advis warn the latest book by thi analyst who is influenti in world circl is entitl out of control global turmoil on the eve of the 21st centuri it is imbu with a sens of acut alarm about the avalanch of uncontrol chang that are occur and the geopolit bloc which we are accustom to call the west which seem monolith dure the period of tough anti soviet confront is start to display intern crack the mani centuri of infight among the european power which end in the 20th centuri in two terribl world war did not disappear in the face of the soviet threat but mere took a back seat today on the eve of a major new rearrang of sphere of influenc thi infight is again make itself felt and so activ that it is call into question the effect of the mechan to creat a unit europ moreov mani analyst special in elabor predict about the chang in the geopolit sphere are point to the fact that by the end of the centuri there will be an exacerb of the unit state relat not onli with china and india but with it current alli germani and japan their claim are base on the fact that the u s economi will continu to be uncompetit against the german and japanes economi not onli in the european and asian market but in the tradit american market too the unit state will have no way to resolv thi conflict other than by polit and militari mean and the possibl of russia s be involv on the american side of cours in pacifi the recalcitr cannot be rule out in a recent interview margaret thatcher express the convict that the maastricht treati would inevit lead to the establish of german domin of europ accord to the iron ladi thi frighten her a lot becaus she believ that germani ha never abandon the idea of achiev world domin and that the german are veri stubborn peopl who ultim alway get what they want the unit german colossu alarm french politician just as much although they tri not to advertis the fact a major factor in ani possibl global destabil remain islam fundament which is root apart from the religi sphere in the muslim peopl natur indign at interfer by the develop countri abov all the unit state in their intern affair there is a grow environment crisi and world conflict is increas after simmer for mani year between the rich prosper north and the hungri poor debt laden south thu along with the control factor of purpos chang the geopolit and militari strateg sphere is be influenc increasingli strongli by the virtual uncontrol group of risk factor which are a consequ of the overal destabil of the intern situat and constitut a major obstacl to a predict evolutionari develop of event the struggl between these two trend will clearli continu to determin the direct of world polit in the next few year there is onli one forc in the modern world capabl of decis influenc thi struggl in the militari polit sphere it is implement through a rang of measur aim at univers establish a new world order and it basic structur are intern supran and suprast organ first and foremost the unit nation with all it subsidiari and ancillari institut the ultim aim of the cosmopolitan elit compris the organiz nucleu of the new world order is to creat a unifi global network of planetari control a kind of world superst run from a unit center and enjoy legal prioriti over local legisl the world s press is activ discuss the question of the legitim basi for intervent all thi make it possibl to assum that the trend toward the forcibl limit of the state sovereignti of disobedi countri will be develop and hone in the veri near futur moreov it is necessari to clearli understand that the develop countri today see the new world order primarili as a way to reinforc their lead posit in the intern commun nonetheless it is obviou that at some point the process of global polit integr will conflict with the interest of the nation state elit in these veri countri the unit state germani or japan if the world s behind the scene power direct the integr process succeed in overcom thi conflict their entir might will be thrown into control further purpos chang in the geopolit and militari strateg sphere in the context of the new world order but if they fail it is quit possibl that the world s elit will use all their influenc to expedit the strengthen of risk factor with a view to deton the situat exploit the result of the gener turmoil and achiev at a time of global crisi what had prove imposs under an evolutionari develop of event on the basi of all thi it seem logic and justifi that the polit foundat of russia s defens doctrin should be laid down take account abov all of the follow provis the qualit differ geopolit and militari strateg situat requir a radic and comprehens reevalu of the militari doctrin of the soviet period which wa base on the bipolar system of a world balanc of power the abandon of the excess geopolit ambit which exhaust the countri s economi and were often dictat not by it nation state or histor interest but by ideolog claim to the rapid victori of world social presuppos the activ reorient of the arm forc to the prioriti of confront region threat to our secur provid of cours that we uncondit maintain our strateg militari potenti at a level where it can guarante to inflict unaccept damag on ani potenti aggressor at the same time the histor continu of our patriot defens mental in all it sphere from militari polit theori to militari strateg practic should also be ensur in realiti thi mean recogn that russia s secur could continu to be safeguard onli in the event of it arm forc be readi to independ and effect counter the full rang of potenti forc threat from the global to the region local and even intern 2 no number 1 as publish the prospect for militari organiz develop should take proper account of the alarm trend in intern polit analysi show that in the forese futur the militari polit situat in the world will be defin by collabor and confront between the three such trend which we previous dub factor of purpos chang risk factor and new world order factor not one of these trend is favor for russia coincid with it long term econom polit or militari interest or promis us anyth new in the futur other than more unrest worri and divers threat and a readi to use forc to counter such threat along with a vigor peacekeep polici to avert them seem to be the most effect combin of the variou mean of safeguard russian secur 3 the russian militari strategi that ha been adopt in the light of present day condit can be character on the whole as a strategi of defens suffici found on the polit basi of healthi nation pragmat thi mean that a the immedi period of russian develop should be seen primarili as a period of stabil dure which it will be necessari abov all to minim the damag done to the countri by the ill conceiv and undistinguish action of politician over the past few year mechan for mobil all of societi s potenti with a view to get the countri out of it profound system crisi as quickli as possibl will have to be elabor prioriti attent to the intern problem of social reviv and nation regener will have to be guarante ani kind of extern state activ will have to be reduc to a necessari minimum to rule out the possibl of russia s get drag into the activ of ani supran intern organ whatsoev which claim a right to interfer in the intern affair of sovereign state and the militari activ of the countri s arm forc will have to be veri strictli limit to the framework of russia s nation interest for the purpos of whose protect they should have the necessari technic organiz and legal base b the materi and personnel resourc channel into defens should be determin on the basi that the most import task in thi sphere is to prevent ani further deterior in russia s militari polit and militari strateg posit in the world arena the event of recent year have reveal that we lack reliabl militari alli therefor the prioriti avenu of militari organiz develop should be to safeguard the countri s secur against both direct militari aggress against it and region threat associ with local area of militari polit instabl escal into the threat of a comprehens geopolit crisi global turmoil 4 along with the concept of healthi nation pragmat and defens suffici the key term in the russian militari doctrin defin it practic featur could now be the concept of vital interest and potenti enemi it would be expedi to introduc the latter term in place of the term probabl enemi which wa discredit dure the cold war if the term probabl enemi is taken to mean state or allianc of state that were view as hostil in the unjustifi ideolog system of refer that prevail earlier then the concept of a potenti enemi could be strip of it state affili and acquir a concret mean independ of ideolog predilect exclus in conjunct with detail and justifi militari polit forecast the exist of potenti militari threat in the modern world is obviou and gener accept consequ the introduct of the propos term should not unjustifi concern anyon sinc it doe not affect the overal defens natur of our militari doctrin at the same time it make the process of shape specif aspect of the state s militari polici and the day to day combat train of russia s arm forc substanti easier in turn the concept of vital interest make it possibl to render the militari organiz develop process clear and purpos wherev it requir cannot be adequ reflect with the help of the simpl potenti enemi definit these interest understood to be russia s legitim right to stake a claim to a geopolit or region balanc of power which would safeguard it secur and territori integr can exist in area where a potenti enemi is simpli absent they may also be made the basi of our militari polici in area where friendli relat with local state mutual loyalti or other factor rule out the possibl of ani other view be taken of the situat and requir a flexibl approach to the safeguard of russian secur it would be naiv to believ that thi brief review could cover all of today s militari polit problem moreov russia s current posit is so vagu and complex so unstabl and changeabl that ani claim that the highli import provis determin the countri s militari secur which we have tri to formul here are final would look veri dubiou nonetheless it is necessari to defin right now the futur basi for our defens doctrin to outlin it specif form and to map out the gener direct of it evolut it is the specialist job to elabor the militari strateg and militari technic aspect of militari doctrin it is the politician duti to elabor the militari polit provis but we must not refrain from emphas that the russian armi s futur lie sole in it link with the peopl v yey narodnosti no mercenari forc and thi is demonstr by the experi of manpow acquisit for the special purpos militia detach is capabl of defend the peopl or of win their support we are oblig to preserv univers militari servic for russia s citizen we are compel by life itself to foster in russian citizen a sens of patriot pride in their motherland and a readi to defend it we must preserv and augment the state s defens capabl and the armi s combat readi it is necessari to clear away mani obstacl and democrat prejudic in thi area
