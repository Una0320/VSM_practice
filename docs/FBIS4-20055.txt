bfn f p 106 interview with jean syrota gener nuclear materi f compani cogema chief execut offic ceo by elisabeth rochard place and date not given syrota s pro nuclear plea text rochard cogema is make profit which are enviabl in the current econom climat and at a time when the nuclear sector is lose momentum around the world how do you explain thi situat syrota it is not true to say that the nuclear sector is lose momentum instal nuclear power continu to rise even if it is rise less quickli than in the past decad moreov a not inconsider number of countri have nuclear program in develop especi in the far east japan south korea taiwan etc howev they are not the onli one we must not forget china which ha a formid number of nuclear facil to be built recent ukrain decid to termin construct work on it vver water cool water moder plant with a design similar to reactor use in the west which had been halt after the chernobyl accid in fact it is the build of new electr product facil that is be victim by overequip and overli poor growth in econom activ the nuclear sector is do rather better than the other thu for japan the unit state western germani and franc taken all togeth two third of instal power between 1983 and 1992 wa nuclear rochard perhap but virtual all new electr plant built in the world in the last few year have been coal or ga plant for more than 10 year the unit state ha not begun construct of a new nuclear plant and if it acquir addit nuclear capac it stem from project that were begun 15 or even 20 year ago syrota of cours but that simpli mean as you say that the growth in electr product in all of the industri countri is lose momentum to get back to the cogema result i think that they are good but we must be abl to do better our ambit is to reach 3 5 percent net profit in the come year the situat of our mine activ is better than befor but it is still far from satisfactori as for the reprocess branch activ will increas in the come year and thi should be reflect in the result cogema s advantag is that it market doe not depend much on the current econom climat howev the poor growth in electr consumpt is slow the construct of new plant which will make our sale more difficult in the long term in a market with slow growth rochard cogema is activ in plutonium recycl are you not expect a halt to be put to thi under pressur from the unit state which doe not have a civilian plutonium industri and with the excus of combat prolifer japan ha recent frozen it reprocess program in thi way syrota i do not agre with your analysi let us look at the most recent event in great britain the thorp reprocess plant ha just been put into servic despit protest and action taken in court by antinuclear activist if there wa intervent it wa not effect i prefer to think that there wa not ani anoth exampl can be found in belgium thi is a veri interest case becaus belgium s percentag of electr of nuclear origin is veri high almost as high as in franc in addit belgium wa the first countri in the world to manufactur mox fuel a fuel in which plutonium replac enrich uranium as the fissil materi for more than 20 year the fuel ha been produc under condit which are satisfactori from all point of view as we recent began reprocess their use fuel in our up3 plant in la hagu belgian electr industri ask their govern for author to load their reactor with mox fuel by recycl their plutonium the govern said ye provid that parliament approv it so an in depth debat wa held in which the issu of reprocess and nuclear energi in gener were rais the belgian parliament vote by a veri larg major in favor of use mox as well as in favor of pursu reprocess contract there too reason won the day as for japan it ha not frozen it reprocess program at all so what ha happen everi five year japan review it long term energi program it then make adjust base on the most recent econom situat and new prospect the fast breeder reactor to follow in the footstep of monju will be built but later than plan with a delay of some 10 year howev it is interest to point out that the monju fast breeder reactor which is the same size as phenix is current be start up the japanes are develop fast breeder reactor technolog becaus they think that they will be of interest in come decad and play an import role in the futur electronuclear sector similarli they have begun construct of the rokkashomura reprocess plant which is compar to the up3 plant in la hagu with a capac of 800 tonn per year compar to us the japanes are lag behind in thi domain but they are catch up and it seem to me that their ambit in the nuclear sector are still just as strong rochard so in your opinion japan is not call it nuclear program into question and while it may be slow down it is onli do so to adapt to demand syrota exactli i can confirm thi for you follow a two week trip i made to japan a month ago dure which i met not onli electr industrialist but also mr eda the minist in charg of nuclear power rochard do you think that china will begin build new nuclear plant syrota i do not see how china can do without them china s economi is grow rapidli at more than 10 percent per year today it main sourc of energi is low grade coal use under poor condit with a per capita incom that is still low china is alreadi one of the biggest emitt of carbon dioxid in the world i heard the reknown scientist georg charpak nobel prize winner explain on televis that the chines would have to give prioriti to develop their nuclear industri rochard the plutonium industri in itself bear the risk of nuclear arm prolifer do you not think that thi risk is greater than the advantag link to reprocess syrota sure not atom bomb can be made without plutonium rememb hiroshima so how are prolifer problem shape up there is current a lot of talk about north korea befor that it wa iraq pakistan india south africa israel and a few other how did these countri tri to get or how did they get the bomb in two way some tri to produc militari qualiti uranium while other tri to produc militari qualiti plutonium in the first instanc it wa via an illeg uranium enrich facil that is what the iraqi and south african did undoubtedli with the help of foreign technolog plutonium base prolifer requir under irradi fuel which must be discreetli remov from a nuclear reactor and the plutonium must be separ from it in a secret reprocess facil thi is the import point the onli way to make militari qualiti plutonium i e virtual pure fissil plutonium is to have under irradi fuel avail if the fuel remain in the reactor for a long time secondari reaction take place and the plutonium contain an ever increas proport of non fissil isotop it then becom unsuit for use in bomb electr compani are tri to obtain the greatest amount of electr possibl with their fuel for obviou econom reason even though the plutonium separ from these use fuel contain a lot of nonfissil plutonium moreov electronuclear fuel reprocess oper are under intern control and they do not lie at the origin of ani exampl of known prolifer rochard the nonprolifer treati is to be renegoti in 1995 what can be done to ensur that it is effect syrota we must not miss the target the problem to be solv is the control of illeg activ experi ha shown that the intern atom energi agenc doe not have problem control countri like franc japan or great britain but doe have problem tri to see what it want in more suspect countri i would reiter that north korea and iraq sign the npt nuclear nonprolifer treati we must do what is necessari so that the agenc can better control the reactor most like to easili produc under irradi fuel better detect illeg program and better supervis transfer of sensit technolog to thi can be ad a new problem that of supervis militari qualiti uranium and plutonium from the upcom dismantl of american and russian weapon one way of resolv thi is to use thi plutonium and uranium to produc electr highli enrich uranium just need to be dilut to make it into nuclear fuel as for plutonium it can be use to make mox fuel becaus wherea electronuclear plutonium is not suitabl for make bomb militari qualiti plutonium can convers be use for electr gener and that is the most ecolog way of destroy it unfortun the american who are the first to be interest do not have the appropri industri solut rochard are you pleas with the decis to restart superphenix as a research reactor although thi reactor wa initi design to make nuclear fuel come full circl and burn plutonium syrota fast breeder reactor can be justifi by the fact that as they use plutonium they make even more of it by transform at the same time non fissil uranium 238 into fissil plutonium 239 so thi is one way of use natur uranium complet the fast breeder reactor produc 40 to 50 time as much energi with the same quantiti of uranium as a light water reactor superphenix wa design with a view to an upcom shortag of uranium and wa made to run optim on thi basi i am convinc that there will not be a shortag of uranium for a veri long time howev thi doe not mean that there is no interest in fast neutron reactor for the futur becaus fast neutron reactor have anoth advantag they are capabl of destroy atom in the plutonium famili actinid and they destroy plutonium s nonfissil isotop much better than light water reactor thi is one of the reason whi it is use to put the superphenix back into servic rochard doe superphenix still constitut a major loss syrota it requir a veri heavi invest which like ani other prototyp will not becom profit as such sinc the invest wa made the choic wa either to put a halt to the program and lose everyth or to do what wa decid rochard after the cadarach accid brice lalond denounc the inadequ safeti demand especi as regard those site which are begin to age badli is there realli a problem syrota extrem rigor examin are carri out to inspect the age of facil the nuclear industri experi the same problem as ani other activ be it chemic steelmak oil product etc howev our industri is subject to far more meticul supervis by the author nuclear oper undertak a vast number of check and spend a lot of money to maintain their facil and replac part that need replac that is whi in my opinion nuclear power should be reserv for those countri which know how to manag advanc technolog and who have the financi resourc to do so as far as develop countri are concern we may well fear that they will skimp on mainten and safeti requir we must not build nuclear plant just anywher in the world rochard doe china meet these requir syrota china need nuclear resourc so much that it will have to meet these requir with the growth rate of it economi it should have the necessari resourc and not succumb to the temptat to make the save which i fear rochard given the state of the nuclear sector in eastern europ the world is still sit on a powder keg where do we realli stand syrota the main risk is chernobyl type plant in gener and chernobyl in particular they can be shut down to do thi there is a solut which is technic simpl to save energi energi consumpt in the countri of eastern europ is so high becaus energi is virtual free there if energi were bill at it true price consumpt would drop and there would no longer be ani need for danger plant rochard what is the impact of the freez on nuclear test for cogema syrota cogema make materi for militari use but the trial themselv have veri littl impact on our order book we no longer have ani order for militari plutonium which wa produc in marcoul and order for militari uranium are also go to stop but we do not know when thi is what worri our employe in pierrelatt but in ani case the plant will not shut down befor the end of 1995 and it would not be until the second half of 1996 that employ problem would crop up rochard sinc you becam the head of cogema in 1988 you have said that you would like to see more capit particip you were talk more about financi establish sinc then total ha becom your sharehold are you look for other partner is the bank insur profil still up to date syrota my answer to both those question is ye there are sever type of potenti partner for cogema financi investor interest in the long term regular profit of our busi industrialist with whom we can develop synergi in our area of activ which is the case with total and lastli commerci partner here we have electr produc especi those who do not have a nuclear fuel industri in their countri i definit hope that someth will happen in the next few month but we cannot say anyth until the agreement have been sign and all the go ahead have been given
