languag f p 105 russian f articl type cso f p 106 interview with professor aleksandr gorbovskiy chief of the f depart for issu of chemic weapon of the committe for convent relat problem of chemic and biolog weapon by nezavisimaya gazeta correspond andrey vaganov and rodion nikolayev under the rubric posit place and date not given russia ha not violat ani treati on chemic weapon as far as destroy these weapon it is as difficult as creat them text one year ago russia wa among the first countri to sign in pari the convent on prohibit of the develop product stockpil and use of chemic weapon and on their destruct thi event complet the proceed of more than two decad of negoti at the disarma confer in geneva the organ for the prohibit of chemic weapon which is headquart in the hagu the netherland wa creat in order to carri out the convent and implement an intern control mechan in russia the committe on convent relat problem of chemic and biolog weapon wa also creat in 1992 by an edict of the russian feder presid the committe wa charg with the function of coordin and control in the area of ensur complianc with russia s intern oblig concern the ban on chemic and biolog weapon professor aleksandr gorbovskiy chief of the depart for the issu of chemic weapon of the committe answer question put by nezavisimaya gazeta correspond nezavisimaya gazeta aleksandr dmitriyevich what is the statu of implement the convent as of today gorbovskiy the convent ha been sign a period of two year ha been set for particip countri to be abl to ratifi it and prepar to meet their oblig the convent will take effect when no fewer than 65 state ratifi it the convent ha now been sign by 154 state but ratifi by onli four countri which do not have chemic weapon and which actual do not have to assum ani oblig thi is a veri seriou problem for other countri that do have such weapon the condit and facil for the destruct of chemic weapon need to be creat the main proport of the world stockpil of such weapon are concentr in the unit state and russia thi is whi the issu of destroy chemic weapon is the most acut for these two state nezavisimaya gazeta what doe the russian chemic weapon complex amount to one find absolut contradictori inform in the press gorbovskiy the russian chemic weapon complex mean first of all the stockpil kept at storag facil the total quantiti of the stockpil ha been declar and come to 40 000 tonn of toxic substanc ov russia also ha facil for the product of toxic substanc the princip facil are in volgograd and novocheboksarsk chuvashia last year an interdepartment commiss whose task it wa to inspect all storag facil for toxic substanc verifi the reliabl of chemic weapon storag and provis for the safeti of the popul as chairman of the abov commiss i can confirm the number given 40 000 tonn nezavisimaya gazeta is it possibl to say what the qualit composit of these 40 000 tonn is and in which region russian chemic weapon are mostli locat gorbovskiy the most up to date nerv substanc sarin soman and v ga vi gaz account for approxim 32 000 tonn the remaind consist of obsolet substanc mustard ga and lewisit which have been store sinc as earli as the 1950 s data on the geographi of the locat of such weapon are no longer secret we have exchang inform with the american on the militari chemic facil the geograph coordin of their locat precis to the second have been provid all these facil are locat in the european section of russia we have seven storag site toxic substanc mustard ga lewisit are kept in contain at two site storag is within munit at five site two storag facil out of these five hold missil and artilleri munit and three storag site aircraft chemic munit the easternmost facil is in chelyabinsk oblast those in bryansk and penza oblast are the closest to moscow the 40 000 tonn are distribut among these storag facil approxim evenli at 5 000 7 000 tonn per storag site nezavisimaya gazeta what is the guarante shelf life of chemic munit gorbovskiy more than 80 percent of toxic substanc are found within munit whose bodi ensur their reliabl storag the inspect of arsen reveal that a case of leakag ha not been regist at ani of them recent american chemic munit have thinner shell thi is precis whi their chemic munit have becom disabl sooner for exampl rocket artilleri munit leak by the mid 1970 s the american were forc to encas them in concret and dump them in the ocean nezavisimaya gazeta what is 40 000 tonn equal to in term of so to say destruct coeffici gorbovskiy a lethal dose of v ga the most up to date chemic toxic agent come to 10 milligram per person thi is a virtual invis aerosol particl it is easi to calcul the number of potenti victim by simpl divis if we know the total stockpil of chemic weapon howev thi would be an incompet calcul it doe not take into account actual condit for the use of all weapon for exampl if we compar how much explos wa use dure world war ii and the number of peopl who were destroy it will turn out that there were hundr of kilogram of trinitrotoluen per person kill the same is the case in the event of combat use of chemic weapon kilogram and ten of kilogram of toxic substanc per each casualti approxim the same casualti rate should also be reckon with dure accid nezavisimaya gazeta what are the specif of russian problem associ with implement of the provis of the convent gorbovskiy unfortun we have to begin work in the area of chemic weapon destruct virtual from scratch after the former ussr announc the discontinu of chemic weapon product 1987 a facil for the destruct of toxic substanc wa creat in the vicin of the citi of chapayevsk within a veri short period of time about 100 million rubl in 1989 price were spent to thi end howev thi facil wa not commiss after all the local popul protest strongli technolog that were suppos to be use at the facil were evalu to be safer than american technolog even by specialist from the unit state mani other industri enterpris are locat in chapayevsk and the ecolog situat in the region wa veri strain there wa absolut no opportun to coordin the commiss of the facil with the local author and the public subsequ major studi were done to develop a draft of the state program for the destruct of chemic weapon as a result specialist came to the conclus that it would be safest and most econom to use for destruct avail former facil for the product of toxic substanc after all in thi case the entir infrastructur did not have to be creat from scratch in particular a plant in the citi of novocheboksarsk wa propos the v ga toxic substanc had been produc there previous howev follow discuss of a draft program at the begin of last year the legisl organ of chuvashia made a decis which rule out the use of the novocheboksarsk product associ khimprom for the purpos of destroy a proport of the stock of chemic weapon nezavisimaya gazeta what is the price tag on the program for the destruct of chemic weapon gorbovskiy it is veri expens a few trillion rubl the follow concept is now take shape chemic weapon will have to be destroy directli in the area of the facil at which they are store a major effort to coordin all issu with the local organ of power and the public lie ahead in conjunct with thi certain articl of an instigatori and even intimid natur serious harm an object assess of the situat thu one year ago articl appear in the newspap of the republ of chuvashia about v ga contamin in a 30 kilomet zone around novocheboksarsk the interdepartment commiss dispatch there for a survey did not confirm thi fact analysi of the sampl of variou media made in special laboratori indic an absenc of contamin one more danger trend ha begun to manifest itself to combin the program for the destruct of chemic weapon with the resolut of ecolog problem associ with the oper of industri as such all thi caus the program to becom still more expens as a result a situat might develop in which russia will be simpli unabl to carri out the program on time meanwhil accord to the convent the first facil for the destruct of toxic substanc should alreadi be in oper two year after the convent is ratifi in five year 20 percent of the chemic weapon should be destroy in seven year 50 percent and in 10 year 100 percent nezavisimaya gazeta more than a year ago moskovskiy novosti publish the notori articl by vil mirzoyanov and lev fedorov poison polit the trial of one of the author of the articl began on monday he stand accus of divulg state secret with regard to the develop of a new type of chemic weapon in our countri could you comment on the situat gorbovskiy at one point i as a repres of the committe on convent relat problem provid explan at a brief concern charg by mirzoyanov and fedorov that russia is violat the intern oblig it ha assum i confirm offici that russia ha not violat ani intern agreement in the area of the ban on chemic weapon either at the time thi articl wa written or at present sinc the product of toxic substanc wa discontinu in 1987 by the ussr it ha not resum the plant were either mothbal or their output mix wa chang i am certain that the american side is also well awar of thi u s specialist have visit former russian facil for the product of chemic weapon besid there are satellit monitor system incident the american themselv precis in 1987 embark on the industri manufactur of binari weapon the outcom of the program for modern their chemic weapon it is precis binari chemic weapon that are the hardest to control within the framework of the convent nezavisimaya gazeta what can you say about the charg that new type of chemic weapon are be develop in russia doe the fact that the novichok 5 new chemic agent ha been develop conform to the truth gorbovskiy thi problem fall within the jurisdict of the ministri of defens of the russian feder rather than our committe legal not a singl state is ban from such activ at present thi ban will onli appli to countri that have ratifi the convent onc it take effect it is known that research on binari chemic weapon ha been conduct in mani countri the experi gain by chemic scientist is now be use to creat intern monitor mechan besid the length of time between a reaction in a test tube and the creation of weapon is mani year or even decad if disclosur of inform on method for the gener of toxic substanc ha occur thi is undoubtedli a danger path lead to the uncontrol spread of chemic weapon and the emerg of chemic terror nezavisimaya gazeta the articl poison polit wa written by two author mirzoyanov spell of name as publish and fedorov nonetheless at present onli mirzoyanov is on trial what is thi about gorbovskiy as far as i know mirzoyanov work with secret inform at the gosniiokht state union scientif research institut of organ chemistri and technolog and natur sign a pledg not to divulg state secret thi is whi charg were file against him as far as fedorov is concern he proclaim that he ha never read secret document anywher nor ha he sign ani pledg thi beg the follow question what doe fedorov stand for as a specialist here is the opinion of him by scientist who know hi past activ well lev fedorov receiv hi colleg educ at the depart of chemistri of moscow state univers while be the parti organ of the class with all requisit privileg for studi exist at the time subsequ there wa graduat studi and defens of a candid dissert howev some time later it came out that the result of hi work could not be confirm hi scienc advis experienc major unpleas becaus of that the first defens of a doctor dissert by fedorov befor the learn council of the imeni a n nesmeyanov institut of element organ compound fail for an altogeth simpl reason plagiar scientif statement which the author pass off as hi turn out to have been borrow from the work of domest and foreign scientist sever year ago have fail to achiev particular scientif success lev fedorov suddenli took an intens interest in dioxin organ compound contain chlorin which are the byproduct of certain chemic product process and pose a certain danger to human lack hi own scientif practic work on thi issu at the time fedorov nonetheless mount vigor activ in thi area mistak him for a dioxin specialist the scientif commun of the citi of ufa invit fedorov to particip in the develop of the republ program for the evalu of dioxin contamin of the natur environ in 1992 strang thi specialist did not make ani practic signific propos and refus to serv on the commiss after the veri first meet undoubtedli incompet peopl such as lev fedorov should not be comment on an import area such as the problem of chemic disarma
