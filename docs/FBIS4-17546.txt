proport to degre of import rather it is the other way around h5 a journey may beckon tomorrow h5 the deputi have done quit a bit of travel to variou part of the world in less than four month 72 member of the duma visit 26 countri as a volgograd deputi told us foreign trip are often a matter of chanc a breathless colleagu race up or mayb bump into you in the elev and ask do you have a foreign travel passport ye come on then we fli thi even where give me your passport you will find out soon enough the stun colleagu doe not resist and inde by even he is walk care up the gangway and onto an airbu it s a reeeal honor to be a deputi admittedli the state duma ha not yet ratifi a singl intern treati although the presid and the govern have sent it around 60 well we live in hope thi after all is the way we are it take a while to break thi anim the altogeth most heat debat at the sit center on whom to send where there wa an unimagin desper polit platform duel for instanc over a problem of great moment for russia whom to send as observ for the elect in south africa it emerg that there were oh so mani worthi peopl admittedli we never had the slightest doubt that in our countri everi member of the duma is prepar to assist not onli de klerk and mandela but also clinton and even arafat h5 that s the duma s lot h5 we do not know how thing stand in rwanda or burundi but parliamentarian in russia are under absolut no threat of physic inact we onc saw vladimir lukin former russian ambassador to the unit state negoti 10 stori in success by foot then on the 10th he suddenli hop into the elev and without breath in the overload button glow dimli and press himself up against the other unbreath bodi he went on up to hi intern affair committe on the 24th floor ala in the former citi hall build the veri same troubl is experienc with the elev as with attend just whi duma member are so unenthusiast about plenari session is a particular topic of convers but an obviou guess would be in run for parliament they were lay claim not onli and not necessarili primarili to the role of legisl for most of them the duma platform is a use springboard from which to launch themselv into celebr statu and win popular but the duma deni itself the chanc of daili televis coverag which mean there is no point race to grab the microphon where is the sens in pontif sole for the benefit of fellow deputi and a hand of journalist sure thi explain the fact that even some faction leader grigoriy yavlinskiy for instanc have never onc deliv incendiari speech actual insid the assembl hall in the entir 100 day while outsid such speech are too numer to count build a polit imag and maintain a reput earn requir skill tactic and rhetor speechifi at the microphon is not alway appropri here incident a word about reput in the opinion of mani duma member from the provinc it is imposs even in two year to break into the world of the famou through the power armor of the capit s monster politician faction and parti leader and the mr minist thi is probabl whi new shine star in the duma firmament are hardli even glimmer on the contrari anoth trend is emerg the provinci deputi attack their own elector district ever more resolut get their governorship and mayor campaign off to an earli start in point of fact a new polit local elit is form in moscow and right here there is no shortag of such duma member we ll place a small wager one in three of those who stand for the next elect to local administr bodi will be from among today s children of the arbat the duma is still locat on the arbat no 36 they will of cours have power competit from the children of dmitrovka the feder council is instal at no 46 dmitrovka but thi to all intent and purpos is one and the same group h5 our conclus h5 the duma ha not justifi the worst expect but nobodi got anywher near the best even for thi the duma member are worthi of our recognit admittedli the deputi of the current convoc like their soviet predecessor feel most pain everi shred of critic direct at them but in our view thi vice can be forgiven the duma member it seem do not read the foreign press much their colleagu abroad frankli have to put up with far more from our foreign colleagu so thi infantil disord of parliamentar is just someth you have to go through that there are veri few place where the presid and the govern would place the suprem repres author in the humili condit experienc in russia is anoth matter but thi is a topic for anoth articl
