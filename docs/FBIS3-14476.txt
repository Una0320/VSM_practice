contravent of intern aviat rule that requir iraq to return it and hand over the hijack as for the iraqi plane that land on our territori against our will we think that as long as the intern embargo remain in place we should keep them as stipul by un secur council and un resolut shihab is your call for a restor of tie with iraq tactic or is it base on strateg consider zarif we view our relat with iraq from a strateg perspect base on a desir on our part to nurtur good and cooper relat with all our neighbor it is in thi frame of mind that we have sought to buri the hatchet in other word we have been tri to rise abov the wound of the war that exhaust our manpow and econom resourc we have work and are still work on start with a clean slate we are reach out to our neighbor in the south of the gulf in the interest of region stabil and to forestal attempt by extern power to destabil the region in order to justifi their continu presenc let me repeat that we are now approach iraq from a strateg perspect natur press issu still need to be address for instanc the prison of war pow s we still think iraq hold a larg number shihab can you be specif about the number zarif the troubl is that the iraqi govern ha been assert for some time that it ha none thi is at odd with our estim we have document to show that there are 8 000 iranian prison in iraq we have provid the intern committ of the red cross icrc with inform about 3 700 prison we also know there are iranian prison in two iraqi camp to which the icrc ha been deni access accord to our record there are 39 000 iranian prison in iraq of whom onli 18 000 are regist with the icrc the icrc know noth about the rest some of these have been in detent for more than five year the question of prison of war is a humanitarian one and so need urgent attent we have been ask our iraqi brother to do someth posit about thi issu so the pow s dossier can be close shihab what wa iraq s repli zarif the iraqi said they had been press to rais the issu of the iraqi pow s in iran and that they had no interest in keep ani iranian pow they said we want to clarifi the matter and clear the air there are mani other issu on which we should cooper so we can succeed in build and enhanc confid between the two side on both the offici and popular level shihab do you have the impress that iraq s repli are true and sincer zarif it is difficult to comment on that howev i hope the iraqi are sincer we in iran and iraq will remain neighbor forev whether we like it or not thi is one of life s realiti shihab have you sens ani iraqi effort to resolv the problem of the pow s zarif we have not yet receiv ani sign of such readi we made propos at the negoti tabl they also explain their view on sever issu shihab did they deni the presenc of iranian pow s in iraq zarif ye they did shihab do you have ani evid support your claim of the presenc of such pow s zarif we have no evid but we strongli feel a larg number of iranian pow s are still detain in camp we are make everi effort to appli un resolut regard relat between the two countri iran ha previous compli with these law and it will continu to do so in the futur shihab regard the aircraft issu the iraqi govern is talk about 100 aircraft while you are talk onli about 20 or 30 iraqi aircraft in iran zarif the problem is that the iraqi believ all the aircraft that left iraq head for iranian territori thi is wrong some iraqi aircraft that took off crash and some other return to iraq iraq believ everi aircraft seen on radar head for our territori and our airspac is in iran thi is untru we are honest in seek a solut to thi problem iran ha about 20 aircraft in iraq some of them were as i said hijack regrett the hijack were not tri or extradit and the aircraft were not return shihab how mani iraqi aircraft crash in iranian territori zarif i don t have a specif figur in mind here i would like to add that some of the aircraft that land in our airport were kuwaiti aircraft iraq seiz after it invas of kuwait we carri out mainten work and return them to their origin owner shihab how mani zarif about six and we still expect the kuwaiti govern to pay the cost of their mainten in iran shihab how may iraqi aircraft are at your airport zarif we had announc the arriv of 22 aircraft includ the six kuwaiti aircraft that were return shihab what are your condit for return the iraqi aircraft zarif the intern embargo impos on iraq doe not allow their return when the embargo is lift we will discuss and resolv the issu within the gener framework of the iraqi iranian relationship our aircraft are still held in iraq and we have to resolv that problem shihab to what extent do you agre with the iraqi govern confront of the establish of a kurdish state especi sinc you have previous said you reject the establish of a new israel on your border zarif we clarifi our posit on the need to maintain iraq s territori integr from the begin after we felt that some had ambit in the region thi wa not a unilater iranian posit syria and turkey share with us the idea dure the period meet we held we agre with mani arab and foreign countri that iraq should remain unifi we reject the partit of iraq ani attempt to partit it will creat problem and danger that will threaten a number of the region s countri from the veri begin we oppos iraq s invas of the state of kuwait we will take a similar posit in the futur on the intern level we also had a similar posit on azerbaijan and nagorno karabakh we also urg some gulf cooper council member state to solv their border disput through understand becaus we believ dialogu is the best mean for understand shihab you are talk about an understand with turkey about the issu of a kurdish state in northern iraq but turkey ha often charg that iran is extend militari aid to ban kurdish group in turkey zarif i have seen such report but turkey and iran have a complet understand about the situat in iraq and the violabl of it territori integr we have also reach an understand on combat terror from whatev sourc it come we look forward to the day when iraq compli with all un resolut and reassert it author on all it territori syria also share thi hope shihab are you worri by the cooper between the kurd and certain western nation zarif human right in iraqi kurdistan is not a new issu what is new howev is the newfound western and american interest in the matter then you have the isra presenc in northern iraq on which we must keep a watch eye shihab what evid do you have of isra kurdish cooper close to the border with iran zarif we have heard much about thi presenc and thi cooper shihab have you receiv report about the matter zarif we have receiv report we are follow them close there are indic that there have been visit and contact that have noth to do with humanitarian and social work they are pure polit and suggest ill intent shihab one of the issu that will come up dure the forthcom visit to baghdad by ali akbar velayati is the futur of iranian and iraqi opposit group mojahedin e khalq and the suprem assembl of the islam revolut of iraq sairi have you reach an understand with iraq on the activ of the two organ zarif from the start of the war impos upon us by iraq mercenari have been work on behalf of the iraqi govern they have mount numer terrorist attack for the enemi we are not worri about the presenc of such hypocrit on iraqi territori howev if iraq realli doe want to turn a new leaf in it relat with iran we will certainli pursu our secur and our peopl s safeti thu if ani terrorist group mount an offens action on our territori we will have to pursu them across the border into iraq where they maintain base cooper between the two countri is hardli advanc by give refug to such peopl they have to be bar from pursu ani activ that will damag relat between iraq and iran shihab how did the iraqi react to your propos regard mojahedin e khalq and sairi led by muhammad baqir al hakim zarif the human right issu in iraq must be address we think the reason that prompt hundr of thousand of iraqi to cross into iranian territori must also be address we are play host to them on humanitarian ground there is no comparison between the presenc of sairi in iran and that of mojahedin e khalq in iraq shihab are we like to see iranian pilgrim visit al najaf and karbala anytim soon zarif thi is one of the issu that we discuss with the iraqi we want to see movement of peopl in both direct for visit to holi site we are strive to work out an arrang shihab when do you expect a solut on that front zarif we have been cooper the ball is now in the iraqi court shihab when will dr velayati visit baghdad zarif within the next two month there are a number of outstand issu we hope will be straighten out through diplomat channel befor a date is set for the visit
