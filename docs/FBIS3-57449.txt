session of the presidium of the new cabinet of minist held friday 21 januari viktor chernomyrdin appeal to hi colleagu to learn to work with the feder council and the duma becaus the govern ha recent gotten out of the habit of work with a parliament and need to establish businesslik tie all the indic are that thi appeal is not just a ritual incant both gaydar and in decemb 1992 chernomyrdin himself start off by promis to cooper with parliament but an indirect statement of the obviou the new govern doe not enjoy widespread polit support contrari to the canon of world democrat practic wherebi either the parliamentari major or a parliamentari parti coalit form the govern the new russian cabinet ha been form by the premier himself viktor chernomyrdin ha as it were satisfi the program demand of the agrarian women of russia the travkinit and the communist thi is precis the reason whi no one duma faction can regard the cabinet of minist as 100 percent it own take the broader view the same hold true for all polit forc at the present time the govern s most reliabl parliamentari alli may be the parti of russian uniti and accord which incident ha not stop sergey shakhray from hedg around hi particip in the cabinet of minist with a list of basic condit liber democrat parti of russia leader vladimir zhirinovskiy would grace the govern with hi polit patronag on condit that kozyrev chubay and shokhin quit howev the remov of these three figur would also satisfi the communist leader gennadiy zyuganov who believ that the struggl between gaydar s men and the pragmatist would end up as a hybrid resolut with a preponder of pragmatist support for the govern from russia s choic look more than doubt it intent not to oppos the cabinet of minist to support all posit undertak and propos which accord with the reform cours which wa enshrin in a statement by thi parliamentari faction onli a week ago did not look entir sincer even then now howev with fedorov s resign and the access to key post of sector lobbyist it is becom far more urgent for russia s choic to exercis the right it ha reserv for itself to critic and if necessari to mobil parliamentari social polit and scientif potenti in order to oppos antireformist and econom irrespons step without act against their conscienc the leader of the yavlinskiy boldyrev lukin faction will almost certainli subscrib to thi declar as might with some reserv member of the allianc of 12 decemb final it is doubt whether the presid will tie himself to the present govern with strong and long term oblig the head of state s autograph which sanctifi the composit of the new govern ha cost chernomyrdin extraordinari effort wherea for yeltsin it ha meant make concess and compromis hi shaki reput as a reform and thi haggl which ha been most unpleas and exhaust as well as yeltsin s inabl to resist pressur from hi premier who ha becom a strong and independ polit figur involuntarili bring us back to a phrase which yeltsin onc let slip regard anoth matter no less sensit to hi self esteem the presid will not forget thi if viktor chernomyrdin is reli primarili on the feder council which ha display unparallel tractabl in elect the premier s favor candid vladimir shumeyko to the post of speaker we do not yet know what price the senat will demand for their loyalti and the issu of who will ultim depend more on whom is still up in the air but the most basic reason that prevent ani one of the parti or faction from uncondit approv the composit of the govern is the duplic of the execut branch which a number of observ have note with what govern exactli follow chernomyrdin s wish is the parliament suppos to establish businesslik tie there is the presid s govern compris the power structur the foreign ministri and the feder televis and radio broadcast administr all of which are directli subordin to yeltsin and there is the premier s govern which is concentr exclus on manag the nation economi these shoot on the execut branch will each bear fruit for both the presid and the premier but yeltsin s harvest is guarante come rain or shine so to speak in the worst case and unfortun most like scenario hyperinfl the polit alibi of the head of state who ha farm out manag of the economi to the head of the govern will be guarante given thi fork of the execut branch the parliamentari faction will onli want to look after their own bit of the govern the bit that is gear toward the figur closest to them the parti of russian uniti and accord will shelter viktor chernomyrdin under it parti wing the agrarian will protect aleksandr zaveryukha new region polici will look after the sector minist and women of russia will back the whole cabinet sinc it support the social orient of the action they are plan for it part russia s choic will rescu the yeltsin govern from the fire line of critic name andrey kozyrev anatoliy chubay pavel grachev and viktor yerin in light of thi prospect viktor chernomyrdin s claim that there is no opposit in the govern to parliament there are onli common interest look highli amus and if the duma implement it initi to compel the govern to give a weekli account of itself we will wit a kind of parliamentari bullfight which we have never seen befor uniti in the feder assembl will probabl onli occur at that desper moment when forecast are say may or june inflat reach yet anoth high and deputi of variou polit stripe so as not to lose face will jointli rais the issu of confid in the govern without bother to divid it into our and their
