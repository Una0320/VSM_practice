trud introduct text in 1959 immedi after graduat from moscow medic institut vladmiir ivanovich mishugin left for sakhalin on assign he wa sent and he went for 5 year he work there on the remot island in a matern home he return to moscow head a depart and becam deputi chief and later chief physician of the hospit he complet intern cours of the world health organ for 13 year now he ha been the chief physician of moscow s hospit no 52 he ha seen a great deal dure these year know a great deal and ha thought over a great deal he ha someth to say what is a hospit a place where they oper treat and care for patient and help them recov their strength but i would put it more briefli a hospit is a center of pain and sorrow that is whi a physician who bend over a patient in the oper room dure resuscit or simpli in a ward intens catch hi breath and puls and see how suffer is replac by hope in hi eye i onc thought that in the physician s conscious there wa no room just then for the thought that would scare sadden or gladden him beyond the hospit wall and that our profess demand such concentr and such self denial but now thi life outsid the hospit dig into the ward everi hour of everi day and sometim you do not know what you must save a patient from from the hypertens crisi that brought him here or from what await him beyond the hospit wall the rule of thumb is that the health of the mass is the properti of the countri so whi then aren t we tri to augment thi properti true thi is a difficult transit time but each individu s life is uniqu peopl are eat poorli the demand for bread and potato is grow veget fruit and juic are far from avail to everyon drug are incred expens one of my doctor friend stop see a patient becaus the patient could not afford the pill he had better find a way to buy them becaus burial are even more expens a bitter joke and in addit life ha twist around so that mani have stop see physician the reason are mani here are the statist a polyclin is design for 20 000 visit each year and ha 10 section and 10 therapist the result are talli 16 000 to 18 000 visit maximum thi mean that they are forc to consolid section and reduc the number of physician as a result the medic servic of the microrayon becom increasingli wors it is a bitter paradox the number of polyclin visit is decreas while the number of emerg call is increas we feel it ourselv there is almost no systemat hospit befor they would hospit you with chronic append for a a cold you would receiv anti inflammatori treatment in a week or two a person wa back on hi feet new they transport you with a ruptur appendix or els with periton but by then there is a threat to life patient arriv in veri grave condit the ambul bring in 50 or more person each day and oper room work day and night becaus often it is alreadi too late for anyth besid a scalpel to help our surgeon are excel but after an oper patient need care otherwis even a person whose oper wa success may be lost and again the wind of the disord of life blow into our ward there is essenti no one to care for patient nurs earn 32 000 and nurs s aid earn 10 500 which is below the minimum pension who will take the job befor young women graduat from medic school and were sent to work in hospit or polyclin now they put their diploma in some remot drawer or els they seek work in commerci situat there are no nurs s aid there are 44 posit in the admiss depart and onli 17 are fill befor moonlight student from the medic higher educ institut fill them and enter hospit life nevertheless today there are none blood pain moan it is better to unload the car at night to earn a few piec in addit to one s stipend than to wheel patient from floor to floor and help the helpless and in the depart take vascular neurolog impair in the brain s blood circul and stroke everyon is bedridden they do not rais their hand their leg are paralyz and their speech is unintellig they cannot feed themselv or perform self care a few are visit by rel often but how mani there are who go without visitor for a month the depart is schedul to have 26 nurs and 18 nurs s aid howev 14 nurs and 2 nurs s aid work there and the depart ha not 70 patient as plan but 87 i will not take the blame our dear nurs work selflessli but can they realli provid real care one wipe the floor throw down the rag quickli wash her hand and goe to give an inject parishion have come from the church they have been call to be sick nurs all trace of them have been wipe out after onli a coupl of week the work is veri hard that is whi a nurs cannot be found and each combin at least two posit it is simpli imposs to live on one nurs s salari nearli 40 percent of our patient are elderli they are the worst of all well we bring them in from an acut situat and everi one of them ha a heap of chronic ill their leg do not work and their pressur is veri unsteadi they are thin and weak you look at just what is hold a soul insid it and we cannot leav them in the hospit longer what we have is a convey the ambul keep on bring them the next one need the cot and it break your heart to sign a patient out just how will he get by thi way at home not long ago they brought in an old man directli from the polyclin he wa suffer from acut hypertens he lay in the ward and we treat and fed him and onc he ask a nurs to telephon hi daughter our verochka becam interest and ask and do you live with your daughter togeth togeth he said and i hand over my pension she is all alon her husband left and she ha two children is she realli in the mood for me we call the apart and onli had time to say thi is the hospit call befor they hung up at the other end of the line and thi happen sever time the old man had to be sign out he wa recov no one came for him what wa there to do they took a car and drove him home it wa lock the neighbor said the littl children are in kindergarten 5 day each week and the mother herself get home late they drove him home the next even and again it wa lock it ate the old man s heart out hi face went blank and he whisper under hi breath you see nobodi need me and what were we to do the daughter had to be found through the polic you start to think and your heart break whom do you feel sorri for i understand how it is for the young woman she work somewher as a recordkeep at a factori she earn 20 000 and assist for her children one time the old man told us that nearli everi morn she took work as a deliveryperson later she moonlight as a helper in a store to have a kopeck for herself after all children must be cloth provid with shoe and fed she would return home exhaust and would again wash cook and scrub the floor and she is still young and want some kind of life but to abandon her father onc i recal hi worri eye i lose all sympathi for the young woman in the hospit i grew attach to our sweet old man and felt sorri for him but would they take him home to hi daughter hi pressur wa brought down but he could bare walk hi joint ach and he had an old man s cough no one would pour him a glass of tea i certainli would not have mention thi case had it been the onli one in nearli everi depart there lie old men who were readi to be discharg long ago but we could not you just don t say leav and their rel are in no hurri to come for them sometim it is wors we drive them home they open the door look out and shout whi did you bring him here he can hardli walk you take care of him it s your duti and sometim enterpris peopl assum guardianship over an elderli person he transfer hi privat apart over to them accord to all the rule and at hi veri first sign of indisposit they send their ward off to the hospit they sell the apart you can whistl for them in a field and where is he to go to the old folk home we need hospit with nurs care let them be hospit that charg everi elderli man and elderli woman ha some kind of pension they can lie calmli get better and recov their strength as much as possibl and they can leav when then are abl to care for themselv we have been talk about thi but what s thi about nurs care hospit they wonder when there are not enough place for patient with acut ill it will happen we will wait until thing in the economi take a turn for the better we were promis thi first in 92 then in 93 and now in 95 thi mean that today s elderli have no possibl of see anyth better what hasn t befallen their fate the camp the war the 5 year plan and the shock siberian construct job can concern for them be put off until after stabil the most terrifi thing is that your close rel refus to buri you as far as i rememb thi never happen befor perhap the man is some homeless vagrant it wa imposs to find hi rel so the hospit had to buri him and then the son come take the death certif and fill out an applic becaus of financi circumst i am unabl to buri my rel i request upon my word thi past year it ha ceas to amaz us ye funer today are incred expens and the grant that the govern give do not even cover one third of the cost but to not send your father wife or son on their final journey to not bend over them not throw a hand of earth into a fresh grave how can one live afterward god what is happen to us we gather in the hospit s staff room in a rare free moment and think of cours peopl s live are hard in some famili they live from pay to pay and they don t have enough bread but realli wa it easi dure the war dure the evacu a mother wa readi to give her last skirt for milk for her littl children and she woke up and went to bed with deathli fear for her husband who wa fight somewher near the dnepr but there wa never such bitter they help one anoth how they could they took care of the littl children and they took piti on the old peopl the common misfortun unit them in the name of one common great purpos victori they were readi to endur but today there are rich as well as poor one child bring a snicker and kiwi to school while anoth mother can onli put a piec of bread into the child s bag no i am not for poverti ridden socialist equal let the rich be they creat job and sustain the public coffer with their tax onli poverti must not be below what we now call the subsist minimum and how much lower can it go if it is alreadi the minimum and nearli everi fourth famili among us live that way is thi not the reason for the bitter mani of those who befor believ in the come commun have now been drawn to the church but even religion will not bring calm to societi the discuss of the politician the democrat the red the brown the market propon the market oppon are loud in anoth famili instead of put the children to bed on time they argu about gaydar and yeltsin until they are hoars excess polit like a diseas poison the conscious simpl human valu compass common experi concern for the elderli and children loyalti to one s wife or husband have lost their worth where are the quiet famili joy when everyon use to gather in the even albeit at a meager tabl but where everyon wa happi becaus despit all the troubl in the world they still had undi love warmth and the comfort of home we physician may understand more clearli than other that it is not onli the physic but also the moral health of the peopl that is in danger onli where are the drug for thi maladi
