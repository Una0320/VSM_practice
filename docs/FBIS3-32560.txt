and went out of control for 24 hour he wa discharg anoth one broke hi leg dure the hardest exercis he wa hospit for treatment but escap from the hospit he wa later found in mina gerai but wa abl to get hi discharg a border platoon is in the middl of the jungl far from everyth there is no place for fun he who is not marri ha no way of find a girlfriend soldier suffer a lot care should alway be taken in the hospit ward they break in at night to steal alcohol there is also a lot of red tape you must get author for everyth if there is a patient in seriou condit and an urgent trip must be made it cannot be done without author h5 coloni vietnam h5 research believ the brazilian armi wa creat in the 17th centuri dure the war to expel the dutch these were not movi type attract battl the portugues crown troop were join by black head by henriqu dia and indian with bow and arrow head by felip camarao and thi is how like in a coloni vietnam the main world power of that time wa defeat without money and unequip the brazilian troop sustain a harsh blow from paraguayan presid marshal francisco solano lopez soldier at the begin of the war with paraguay they repres the countri in world war i with tragic consequ the lack of medic assist wa such that soldier sent to the battl field did not die from be shot in the trench but rather on their way there due to the spanish flu epidem the brazilian arm forc have made a lot of progress but are still far from what the leadership aspir money is their biggest problem defens rather than combat strategi are current discuss at the brazilian militari academi where the great alli of the past is regard as the possibl enemi for the futur mani militari men believ the wealth of the amazon attract the greed of great power such as the unit state under an extrem situat those countri may promot an intervent under the pretext of fight drug traffick and defend the indigen reserv thi is whi brazilian militari men regard with suspicion the u s militari maneuv on the border the truth is that if one of those attack which foreign like to plan were to materi attack which are in realiti onli imaginari the frail brazilian defens system would be unabl to even leav it post modestli speak brazil is just one of sever countri in a similar or even wors situat mexico for exampl whose arm forc onli have strategi to confront the rag zapatist or an unlik conflict with it southern neighbor the minut guatemala as for it northern neighbor it ha come to a hard but realist conclus the differ is so great that in the case of a more and more unlik u s invas follow nafta the mexican armi would just wait and see what it can do militari men natur awar of a third or even fourth world apparatu use thi neg aspect as the great excus to demand a bit more from the feder treasuri at least to keep up appear h5 lead pellet h5 the problem in brazil today is that if everyth continu unchang the countri must be told that the arm forc have becom the disarm forc the state of the equip is piti although nobodi expect to find tomahawk missil the great attract of the persian gulf war on a brazilian ship not just becaus they are not avail local but also becaus each missil cost 15 million neither can one expect the rifl to be fit overnight with infra red equip that enabl enemi target to be hit in complet dark british soldier had these dure the malvina war which help them hit argentin soldier who did not even know where the shot came from brazilian militari men believ howev that some urgent improv must be made the armi would be much better off if it had a group of well train and equip troop capabl of immedi action anywher in the countri that ha a 7 400 km borderlin and 10 neighbor countri of the 235 000 armi troop onli some 20 000 to 25 000 are capabl of thi not much more is necessari some 50 000 men would be better but 40 000 would do minist zenildo lucena explain nobodi consid have an expens armi under the present situat in the countri there could be more resourc for train purpos the artilleri for it cannon train use the same lead pellet use for the compress air rifl at fun fair thi is not so bad becaus they are excel for train the soldier to improv their aim they are also cheap a singl real cannon shot cost some 5 000 one must pretend that it is the genuin thing the other arm forc branch are no better off becaus they are pay the price of a common heritag they were prepar for the cold war year when it wa thought the brazilian arm forc would mainli be use to assist the unit state in an eventu conflict with the ussr thi theori ha disappear and we are face a situat of men and equip train to fight a nonexist enemi but now they are not even equip to fight ani adversari that may eventu materi h5 solo flight h5 the navi s problem start with it main ship the aircraft carrier mina gerai a relic of the british navi thi aircraft carrier wa refurbish upon it arriv at the brazilian shipyard to fulfil a specif mission to defend the brazilian coast from an eventu attack by the soviet submarin fleet in view of thi the mina gerai onli carri slow and heavi plane those use to search and hit underwat target the mina gerai is equip with missil to attack approach plane but it is unabl to transport light plane capabl of confront an enemi squadron at a safe distanc so that the ship may not be damag former navi minist admir maximiano da fonseca said the mina gerai is in no condit to enter war becaus it would have to be defend the other ship are in a similar situat six frigat acquir 20 year ago from england were also outfit to combat russian submarin in the cold war navi battl but today they would be unabl to defend themselv from bomb drop from a small plane they were alreadi old when they were bought in 1973 the major are 50 year old the use life of a vessel of thi kind doe not surpass two or three decad the air forc is face similar problem but more center on volum the navi is at least abl to place it entir fleet at sea to conduct exercis like the armi it ha suffici resourc to feed it troop although far from be a five star meal a militari meal consist of rice black bean salad and either beef fish or chicken it would not fair too badli in a food tast contest with factori restaur the air forc busi hour start at 1300 so as to save money on meal for lack of money for fuel half of it pilot will not fli thi year those who do will fli museum piec the mirag are so old the manufactur ha ceas to produc the spare part essenti for their mainten the amx is a good plane but it wa also conceiv for the cold war h5 stigmat h5 the combin of low salari and outdat equip worthi of a scrap yard is a pothol among intens dissatisfact the most noteworthi fact on the condit of the militari today is the feel of loss of prestig both social and materi until recent militari men were entitl to a bonu for the number of flight hour they flew no matter the natur of the mission or it prioriti they onli had to buckl their safeti belt and wait for the bonu to pay their bill at the end of the month thi privileg ha been cut they were also abl to transform state run compani into beauti job sourc a colonel went into the reserv and in addit to hi retir pension receiv a second salari run in the million when a gener did not receiv hi fourth star he wa appoint vice chairman of an industri as a consol prize these time are over militari men view the constitut revis with reserv becaus they fear the situat will deterior even further they fear their pension will be place under the jurisdict of the miser inss nation social secur institut although a militari man s salari is bad pension are optimum they receiv their full salari and a retir bonu when he goe into the reserv a militari man is entitl to the benefit of the next highest rank when he wa on activ duti a captain becom a major a colonel becom a gener and so on thu the averag pension of militari men is about 14 minimum salari 10 time more than the pension a common mortal receiv from the inss militari men feel stigmat by the press disdain by a good major of cultur peopl and mistreat by the administr they serv the major feel that if pro and con were place on the scale their 20 year period in power wa posit they believ the term militari dictatorship is offens they think those who use the term militari regim are commit an indiscret and when they talk to civilian they toler as bearabl the definit authoritarian period they detest be remind of what they did wrong the suppress of individu freedom censorship and the miss but love to rememb what they did well in fact it wa an armi school the engin militari institut that draft the project to establish a more modern telecommun infrastructur in the countri better than that of our neighbor they are proud of the growth rate dure the miracl period the low inflat rate that prevail at the time and job expans never mention the foreign debt hike pleas h5 cheaper labor h5 the militari men of the 1964 regim may be accus of have turn a blind eye to the underworld of civilian deal made under their nose they fought the corrupt of their polit enemi but remain impass to the dirti money of their friend howev when they retir it wa obviou that none of them had amass great amount of money some sector of the arm forc reveal an unusu compet in the state apparatu they are capabl of establish and fulfil long term project compar to the public enterpris that do not even inform the presid of the republ about their worker s salari they are disciplin and have a great work capac peopl can say what they like about the brazilian war industri it is expens subsid anachronist but the fact is that when they built thi industri the militari made it the fifth largest of it kind in the world some may feel that the research carri out by the navi is a wast of time and money but it laboratori which even produc artifici sweeten for the admir coffe ha manag to master the uranium enrich technolog and is now work on a nuclear propel submarin the arm forc as if they felt they must justifi their exist at ani cost current engag in activ that have noth to do with the militari world in parana the armi is involv in an old railway project the ferroest to transport soybean through the state a consortium of privat enterpris want 300 million to build a portion of the railway line it wa establish that two engin battalion could do the job for 200 million and the deal wa close the project is do well the price quot by the construct compani wa undoubtedli abus but the project in parana beg the question doe the countri need the arm forc just becaus there are not enough train to transport soybean rio de janeiro is anoth exampl the citi love the tank and rifl that guarante the normal develop of eco 92 un sponsor environment confer the 7 000 inhabit of the roquett pinto shantytown now celebr the presenc of 20 men patrol from a nearbi battalion that sever time a day visit the town

dentist will be establish roquett pinto which in the past wa a drug traffick and consumpt center ha now becom a peac area there wa probabl no altern last octob shot from roquett pinto hit the barrack it is obviou thi is not a solut becaus armi soldier are not train to deal with the civilian popul their idea of disciplin cannot be appli to the daili activ of a common citizen and experi ha proven that they can end up involv with local delinqu or caus tragedi among well intent peopl thi wa the case in volta redonda when armi troop call to interven a worker strike end in the death of three worker of the plant or under the 1964 regim when offic assum the work of interior ministri agent and end up stain by the habit of beat up student who were handcuf last week in rio de janeiro member of

withdraw the soldier the traffic began to circul a few minut later but a true polit uncertainti wa experienc know who is the real boss in the portion of the guanabara bay between rio de janeiro and niteroi h5 fund and mental h5 if the militari are not suppos to replac contractor play the role of polic or much less control transit what should they do that is the question if they exist to fulfil the function defin by the constitut like preserv intern and extern secur alway at the request of one of the branch of govern it is true that the arm forc are not onli poorli paid they also improperli spend the scarc fund that they receiv there is an excess number of personnel at higher level in sever garrison there are gener do the work of colonel there is an excess number of intermedi offic whose duti are almost decor and who repeat to their subordin the instruct they receiv from their superior a fax machin would be cheaper and without the risk of make a mistak it is a close system in which even a citizen without ani devot or capac for the job can stay earn some promot and after a career with job stabil can retir without ani shock if the armi need onli 50 000 well train men to cope with ani emerg whi doe it keep 235 000 soldier in the barrack and whi are the major of the troop of the three forc in larg urban center when all three have defin the amazona region as their main prioriti there is a problem involv fund but there is also a problem of mental thi is a debat that ha not been held in brazil for a long time a debat on a project for brazil the arm forc are not surviv in an
