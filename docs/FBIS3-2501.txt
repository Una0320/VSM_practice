enjoy a lower crime rate in murder rape and robberi and ha a smaller proport of prison china ha mani good qualiti in term of human right democraci seem to be the develop trend for the whole world and is irresist from a long term point of view howev the form and speed of a countri s democrat process should be determin by the countri s cultur tradit and concret nation condit china must not indiscrimin copi the form of democraci current in practic in the unit state and the west to the vast number of the chines common citizen who have just resolv the problem of have suffici food and cloth and are head for a fairli comfort life human right and democraci are just like decor ornament total differ from the hand of dissid in china to whom american journalist human right organ and a few u s senat have paid much of their attent the overwhelm major of the chines peopl are most concern about the econom prosper of the countri a clean and industri administr stabl commod price and social order and better privat live the unit state attempt to facilit the emerg of an opposit parti in china face the demand of the unit state on the human right issu the chines side ha tri hard to accomplish all it can yet will never do anyth which is not attain at the present stage china s reluct to make major move on u s human right concern stem from two worri firstli china is worri that the u s human right demand will turn out to be a bottomless pit for exampl the unit state may ask china today to releas a coupl of peopl and china set them free accord to realist condit yet tomorrow the unit state may again demand the releas of more and later start urg china not to arrest anyon while releas prison as a matter of fact the real intent of the unit state in impos human right pressur on the chines govern is to facilit the emerg of an opposit parti in china which will put on a rival show against the govern not that the leader of the chines govern do not want to expedit the pace of polit reform becaus china s modern drive can onli succeed when polit and econom reform are carri out at the same pace they are just worri about the possibl emerg of major social turmoil insid china china is a multin countri which ha a big popul and a weak econom foundat moreov becaus of their gener low cultur qualiti mani peopl still cling to the deep root remain of the feudal ideolog as a result china ha found it polit reform far more difficult than econom reform under such circumst if anyon pursu quick result in polit reform major turmoil is bound to break out in china the chines govern and peopl shiver with fear when look back at the anarchist state brought by the full democraci dure the great cultur revolut as well as at the thought of the present chaotic situat and tragedi in the former soviet union russia and eastern european countri h5 polit reform take time h5 the u s govern also admit that a strong stabl and democrat china is benefici to the interest of the unit state if it realli wish to see a strong stabl and democrat china the unit state ought not to impos an unduli heavi pressur on china at a prematur time impos an unduli heavi pressur is tantamount to tri to make peopl do someth which they do not wish to do sinc democraci can onli be built on the basi of social stabil and econom develop the chines govern ha regard it as an urgent task to dilut ideolog awar and firmli seiz favor intern opportun to bring about further develop to it economi thi is a wise decis and the chines peopl all show their approv with their hand up a high degre econom reform will inevit bring about polit reform howev polit reform in china take some time and one should not expect to reach the sky in a singl bound so long as u s secretari of state warren christoph aim hi china visit at seek common ground on major issu while reserv differ on minor one at build up mutual trust and at expand the foundat of cooper between the two countri i believ that hi visit to china will be a success therefor there is no need for the unit state to give up eat grant mfn statu to china for fear of choke human right
