languag f p 105 japanes f articl type cso text look at the electr power develop coordin council s goal until 2002 about 28 percnt of fy99 s approxim 900 trillion kw is calcul as necessari analys show that a yearli growth of 2 5 percnt is need and that nuclear power plant must also be equip for up to 54 million kw nuclear power which is essenti for energi secur alreadi play the role of support the way of life in japan it support the inform societi keep industri stabl and guarante a comfort way of life thi concept of energi secur is also the basi of japan s govern polici on atom energi and it is essenti for chang the weak natur of energi so that energi can be ensur into the futur japan ha been involv with nuclear power sinc the atom energi act wa institut in januari 1956 11 year after the war that law is base on the polici that atom energi is to be limit to peac use premis on the guarante of safeti manag democrat and that it result are to be made public it wa also a decis made by japan one of the world s most nuclear allerg countri japan s atom energi develop start with enrich uranium and then burn it as fuel in boil water reactor bwr pressur water reactor pwr or high temperatur ga reactor later while use the plutonium made in those reactor japan went on to convert deplet uranium u 239 which wa not use befor into plutonium and use it in fast breeder reactor from which the amount of energi produc plutonium is more than the amount consum plutonium furthermor japan is follow the road to nuclear fusion reactor atom energi util plan that involv the use of plutonium in particular form the basi of the govern s atom energi polici and that sort of plan ha been emphas sinc the begin of japan s atom energi develop the reason for the promot of that govern polici is first and foremost the effect use of resourc 1 the uranium resourc that becom nuclear reactor fuel are presum to be in reserv of about the same amount as petroleum reserv and are limit in anoth hundr year or so when the econom offset uranium can no longer be mine that amount is estim to be two and four million ton thi uranium is not just for use by japan and the other wealthi countri whose atom energi develop is advanc with the rate of econom develop in develop countri we can see how after a while countri will no longer be abl to use uranium freeli 2 use plutonium can be 10 or more time effici than use uranium trial calcul show that the approxim 70 year worth of uranium reserv can be expand to 3 600 year worth that is the big reason for use plutonium the result of develop in plutonium util are bear fruit in the 31st year next april the monju reactor which use plutonium for fuel to gener electr is to reach critic with that the develop of reactor that use plutonium will be all the more definit that is also the way to skip ahead to the forefront of atom energi develop given the wane interest in such develop with the new clinton administr in the u s thi use of plutonium is not someth that the world welcom as the plutonium transport ship the akatsuki maru experienc thi januari there are also highli vocal misgiv about plutonium use that link to nuclear weapon to clear away such doubt japan ha alreadi made clear it posit on the need for plutonium fuel base reactor develop japan is also activ work to make sure that the develop is limit to peac use and is transpar enough to be understood in electr power gener by mean of light water and other such reactor plutonium produc within the fuel rod provid one third of the electr power gener when a light water reactor oper plutonium is turn natur into energi for electr power and that amount reach up to one tenth of the total amount of electr power produc by thermoelectr hydroelectr and other power plant use plutonium serious involv even more activ util of the plutonium produc within nuclear reactor the way to do that is to remov plutonium in a state in which it is mix with uranium from spent fuel then to burn it in a special kind of reactor a fast breeder reactor fbr and also to use the plutonium in combin with bwr and pwr fuel with the fuel for nuclear reactor center on light water reactor onli a mere 1 percnt of the burnabl uranium uranium 235 contain in the uranium ore can be util the remain 99 percnt is unburn uranium uranium 239 that is discard the use of plutonium ha two aspect convert that unburn uranium into plutonium with a special reactor like the monju and then activ use that plutonium and use the plutonium produc in the fuel rod of light water reactor establish the technolog for that will lead to achiev the goal of expand uranium usag by 10 or more time and japan s creation of a new man made energi the first stage in the seriou use of plutonium is the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corp s monju fbr that reactor whose technolog is base on the 100 000 kw joyo experiment reactor that reach critic in 1977 is japan s first fbr for electr power gener construct of the monju reactor which will have an electr output of 280 000 kw start in octob 1985 in 1991 equip instal wa complet and comprehens test conclud and on 13 octob the initi fuel load wa carri out critic is expect to happen in april 1994 furthermor there is also a demonstr reactor project underway to develop a commerci fbr base on monju technolog and the conceptu design for that is alreadi complet the demonstr reactor which is be develop by the japan atom power co will have an electr output of 1 million kw and the cost of it construct will be 1 5 time that of a light water reactor the construct of thi demonstr reactor is seen as a project with a definit time period even in the long term atom energi develop and util plan that is be written thi year the plutonium util rout will becom certain in addit the privat sector start the construct of a reprocess plant that will be the decid factor of the nuclear fuel cycl the reprocess plant will suppli plutonium fuel to the fbr that are under develop ground prepar are now be made for the reprocess plant which will be in the rokkasho reprocess plant that the japan nuclear fuel co is build in rokkasho mura aomori prefectur the reprocess plant is to start oper in 2000 and will have the capac to reprocess the spent nuclear fuel from about 30 1 million kw power plant 800 ton per year the plan is for the plant to produc about 50 ton of plutonium by 2010 the plant will use a wet method the purex method to dissolv spent fuel in nitric acid and then separ the uranium plutonium and fission product in order to prevent the plutonium from be convert into nuclear weapon the plutonium and uranium will be in an oxid state and will be remov just as they are mix in a one to one ratio the reprocess plant will be a plant that take nuclear nonprolifer into consider at the same time to answer ani doubt extra care will be taken to guarante the control of nuclear substanc and the emphasi will be on a manag system in which there will be no extract of plutonium from the product process and no plutonium with an unknown destin the sta is also give seriou consider to secur measur for the reprocess plant in the budget for next fiscal year it will establish an industri level nuclear substanc manag system by put the secur measur center next to the plant the sta is develop contain surveil equip that will enabl manag without a supervisor present and weigh devic that take inspect into account in addit to the reprocess plant there are other facil in rokkasho mura a uranium enrich plant is in oper by about thi winter uranium produc there will be ship for the first time there is also an underground low level radioact wast center which process the low level radioact wast gener by power plant that went into oper in decemb 1992 a high level radioact wast manag facil which will store high level radioact wast gener from domest and oversea reprocess is now under construct the task of equip the main facil for a nuclear fuel cycl is steadili progress japan also emphas the import safeti issu that go along with atom energi develop facil for nuclear fuel cycl safeti engin research are also be equip those facil are involv in research on the prevent of sever accid in pressur water type light water reactor that use a larg non stationari state loop lstf the rosa v project test research on reactiv accid use a nuclear safeti research reactor nsrr and the evalu of nuclear fuel facil the result achiev in thi atom energi develop reach world class level and are come to the point where japan will assert how a manag system should be in issu such as manag the excess plutonium gener from the dismantl of nuclear weapon at the 37th gener meet of the intern atom energi agenc sta director gener eda clearli state that becaus of japan s energi situat japan will not bypass nuclear power and will util plutonium for strictli peac purpos japan made clear to the rest of the world that despit the chang in the administr the new govern will take over the atom energi develop that ha taken place thu far in japan then in regard to a system of intern manag of plutonium which draw the most concern in the world japan announc it strong intent to play an intern role thi way of think i e to increas transpar by make clear the plan for use plutonium for peac purpos and the whereabout of the plutonium is back by japan s long period of atom energi develop for peac purpos at the brink of the 21st centuri the world s economi will grow more and the energi use by develop countri will increas the develop and util of atom energi is seen as someth to acceler and japan s histori will be a model
