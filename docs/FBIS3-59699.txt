found in 1986 to carri out research on the use of petroleum energi sinc it foundat develop of naphtha kerosen util technolog for fuel cell system ha been one of the main program the program consist of three subprogram to develop pafc mcfc and sofc system use light petroleum fraction such as naphtha or kerosen as raw fuel h5 1 develop of pafc h5 h5 1 1 develop of naphtha util technolog for pafc h5 pec conduct a technolog develop program in order to util light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for pafc from 1986 through 1990 seven petroleum one electr applianc manufactur and one engin construct compani particip in thi program main topic of the technolog develop are as follow 1 develop catalyst for hydrodesulfur partial crack hydrodesulfur and adsorb desulfur of naphtha and or kerosen 2 develop nobl metal base catalyst for reform 3 demonstr naphtha fed pafc 50 80 100 200kw h3 1 2 technolog develop for commerci of naphtha fed pafc h3 base on technolog develop in the abov mention program we are now practic a 5 year technolog develop program for commerci of petroleum fed pafc in thi program six petroleum compani particip and two fuel cell manufactur cooper with pec we have manufactur two naphtha fed commerci prototyp pafc 50 200kw the differ between these two prototyp are seen in the type of the reform catalyst reform type fuel cell itself and so on the size of the prototyp were chosen becaus these are gener use in cogener in the market the 50kw prototyp start it oper in thi past juli and is now continu stabl and satisfactori oper it is locat in chiba prefectur in an aqua hous which ha fair number of japanes type public bath in the build electr and heat are use for their water heat the 200kw prototyp is go to start in thi octob and it is locat in the research facil area of rite research institut of innov technolog for the earth situat in kansai scienc citi in kyoto thi 200kw prototyp is one of new energi facil in rite consist of fuel cell solar energi and wind energi test facil the main stress of thi project is put on catalyst develop and total fuel cell system engin the reform catalyst use in these prototyp are the one develop by pec in the preced 5 year program and improv later on also for improv the compact of the fuel cell packag pec ha develop a new eject type naphtha vapour the item to be verifi are 1 demonstr the activ and life of the hydrodesulfur catalyst and reform catalyst 2 demonstr the reliabl of the fuel cell 3 for the total system demonstr reliabl oper flexibl mainten eas econom and so on h3 1 3 technolog develop for commerci of kerosen fed pafc h3 as a raw fuel for fuel cell kerosen is much harder to desulfur and reform and need newli develop catalyst in a catalyst evalu pilot plant in the advanc technolog amp research institut which is an organ of pec sever catalyst develop by pec are be test now to decid the best one to the kerosen fed pafc the 200kw kerosen fed experiment prototyp is now be manufactur and will start it oper in the abov mention laboratori in late 1994 h5 2 develop of mcfc h5 h3 2 1 develop of naphtha util technolog for extern reform mcfc h3 pec conduct a technolog develop program in order to util light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for extern reform mcfc from 1986 through 1990 one petroleum one electr applianc manufactur and one engin construct compani particip in thi program summari of the technolog develop is as follow 1 develop reform catalyst for mcfc 2 investig effect of sulfur compound and water includ in reform ga on fuel cell compon 3 improv materi for wet seal and electrolyt 4 demonstr a naphtha fed extern reform mcfc 10kw attain the target effici of 45 percnt h3 2 2 develop of light petroleum fraction util technolog for intern reform mcfc h3 pec ha been conduct a 5 year technolog develop program in order to util light petroleum fraction such as naphtha for intern reform mcfc sinc 1990 two petroleum one electr applianc manufactur and one engin construct compani have been take part in thi program outlin of the technolog develop is as follow 1 demonstr 10kw direct intern reform mcfc stack and test data are now check against the design the size is one of the biggest in the world 2 30kw direct intern reform mcfc system will be made in 1994 and a continu run is plan 3 the mechan of catalyst poison by molten carbon ha been studi and been minim both from liquid phase and vapour phase from thi develop the singl cell is continu it run beyond 6 000 hour h5 3 develop of sofc h5 pec ha been conduct a 5 year technolog develop program in order to util light petroleum fraction such as naphtha for sofc sinc 1990 three petroleum compani have been take part in thi program outlin of the technolog develop is as follow h5 1 tubular sofc system h5 1 develop a thin layer electrod and electrolyt by plasma spray which is a method to give good possibl of larg cost down in the manufactur of sofc cell compar with the ecvd method 2 develop a reform catalyst which give methan rich reform ga thi reform ga ha an intern cool effect in a fuel cell by it heat absorpt in a reform reaction to hydrogen and can improv the total heat effici by decreas extern cool medium h5 2 planar sofc system h5 1 improv properti of electrolyt electrod and separat and thu demonstr a 1 3kw stack at 50 percnt fuel util 0 2w cm 2 attain power densiti of 0 19w cm at 5cm squar singl cell at 40 percnt effici 3 a 10kw stack will be attain in 1994
