into the east china grid and the commerci oper of the no 1 unit of the guangdong daya nuclear power plant also began at the close of thi year and it will be deliv power to guangdong and hong kong well into the futur as china welcom the arriv of nuclear power thi energi sourc is alreadi suppli one sixth of all of the electr use in the world in 1992 424 nuclear power reactor were oper in variou countri throughout the world h3 1 nuclear power the key to solv the problem of develop h3 in the 1960 and 1970 as china wa ship it northern coal resourc to the south nuclear power wa grow sharpli in europ and america in over 30 year the u s built more than 100 nuclear power reactor and becam the lead nuclear power countri in the world franc made it a nation polici to solv it energi shortag by develop nuclear power and in onli 17 year sinc 1973 the ratio of nuclear power rose from 4 percent to 72 percent and cheap reliabl nuclear power ha becom the pillar of the french economi today one third of all of the electr power use in the energi poor countri of the european econom commun come from nuclear power in short the fact is that the develop countri of europ and america know there can be no entri into the 21st centuri without nuclear power in the 1980 the center of world econom growth move to the asian pacif area and the nation of the pacif rim and the nuclear accid at three mile island in the u s and at chernobyl in the soviet union cast a cloud over the idea that nuclear power wa the key to econom develop nuclear technolog forc in europ america and japan are collabor in appli research on a new reactor that is safer cleaner more econom and consum nuclear materi more complet the fast breeder reactor advanc nation have increas their research on nuclear fusion which could provid mankind with an inexhaust suppli of energi there can be no doubt that nuclear energi will be an import sourc of energi in the 21st centuri countri that do not gain access to nuclear energi will not join the rank of advanc countri in the futur world h3 2 nuclear power the antigen for prevent of econom difficulti on the southeast coast h3 the energi shortag ha becom the bottleneck to china s econom develop the energi pinch is most strongli felt along the southeast coast which is also feel the effect of transport pressur and environment pollut and the disloc energi structur is the root caus of it all china s coal resourc are mainli concentr in shanxi shaanxi and western inner mongolia 70 percent of the hydropow resourc are in the southwest and 80 percent of the electr in the southeast is produc from coal northern coal is ship south and western coal is ship east coal for electr power account for 46 percent of the freight ship on the beij shanghai and beij guangdong rail line 30 percent of the freight on the huangjin waterway and 26 percent of the freight on the highway and that still doe not satisfi the demand in jiangsu provinc there have been shutdown of over 40 percent of the power gener becaus coal suppli were use up while coal provid the power for econom develop it also is the caus of transport and environment problem one 1 000mw thermal power plant discharg ten of thousand of ton of harm gase contain sulfur dioxid and nitrogen oxid into the atmospher everi year and more than 100 kilogram of such carcinogen as mercuri and cadmium how then to extric the southeast coastal econom zone from the grip of energi transport and environment problem if as with a singl surgic stroke to cure three ailment there were a singl energi resourc which with a singular invest could heal all afflict wouldn t that be more ideal let those who would send hydropow over extrem distanc behold the light of nuclear power it is easi to see the advantag of nuclear power over coal power a 1 000 mw pressur water reactor need onli 30 ton of fuel a year which is 1 one hundr thousandth that of a thermal power plant of the same scale pollut from a safe oper nuclear power plant is neglig it radiat discharg be less than a coal power plant of the same scale in 1970 have heard report on the situat in shanghai premier zhou enlai said that the solut to shanghai s energi shortag is nuclear power nuclear power ha been the antidot for mani energi defici place in the world that have concentr popul and rapid industri growth and there is littl doubt it will be good medicin for the southeast coastal area h5 3 nuclear power not easi for china h5 although the advantag of nuclear power are obviou although china ha plenti of uranium to support nuclear power although through the process of develop nuclear weapon the uranium mine industri grew well uranium isotop were separ nuclear fuel element were produc as plan reactor were built and spent fuel wa process all of which round out a complet nuclear industri system although china ha a forc of nuclear industri specialist ten of thousand strong with decad of hard experi and train although china s basic industri are well develop and can meet the requir for develop nuclear power nuclear power is nonetheless in an infantil stage in china by the end of septemb the qinshan nuclear power plant had gener a total of 1 7 billion kwh of electr power ad the power gener by the two 900mw unit of the daya bay plant as of late 1993 and mid 1994 nuclear power provid onli 1 percent of the total output of electr in china china wa late on the scene and miss out on the biggest opportun for develop on 28 februari 1990 qian sanqiang li jue jiang shengji and wang ganchang submit a statement to jiang zemin and li peng call for the earli establish of mid and long term plan for china s nuclear power develop and express the sincer concern and interest that the four distinguish elder scientist and leader have for their countri and their peopl on 30 april premier li peng respond to them by letter say on 15 march the state council nuclear power leadership group plenari session determin that nuclear power would be includ in the nation econom plan the coastal provinc of fujian zhejiang jiangsu shandong liaon and hainan and the inland provinc of sichuan jiangsu and hunan have all express their desir to build nuclear power station and the strateg goal for the countri today is to speed up develop and get into the race in august 1993 the china nation nuclear industri corpor assembl the talent and facil in it nuclear engin design prospect construct facil acquisit and technic servic field to form the china intern nuclear engin group enterpris to gain some ground in open up a nuclear power market there are howev some obstacl to move forward just yet becaus the role of nuclear power in china s econom develop is not fulli recogn by the polici maker there is no unifi leadership among nation nuclear power depart and the lack of guarante fund sourc is a hindranc to scientif research and construct nuclear power construct requir earli invest and it success depend heavili on safeti and financi guarante the two other nuclear power plant now tabl for construct are the guangdong and bohai bay plant in liaon are thoroughli plan from the safeti standpoint but whether firm fund will be assur is anoth matter the develop of nuclear power is a complex system of engin becaus of it particular requir for end to end facil research and product suppli nuclear fuel process deplet fuel process the three wast and the select and releas of power plant site and the engin process demand a high degre of unifi leadership and decis action without it the applic of nuclear power to the econom bottleneck will not realiz it maximum advantag and onli that will fulfil the dream of the nuclear workforc slake the countri s thirst for electr power and brighten the heart of the peopl china need the light and heat of nuclear power to break the bottleneck
