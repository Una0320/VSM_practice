enterpris began econom on environment protect expenditur under these critic condit the state of our economi is still have an advers effect on the state of our environ the ecolog catastroph is not a threat to our countri alon howev the econom activ of human be and their effect on natur have increas to such proport that they have turn the problem of protect the biospher into a planetari or global concern without ani fear of exagger we can say that the surviv of the human race will depend on it abil to solv thi problem onli a comprehens approach to environment problem can promot the more effect protect and intellig use of ecosystem the guarante of a safe futur and the harmon of man s relationship with natur no countri is capabl of do thi alon thi can onli be done through concert effort on the basi of a global partnership for the sake of sustain develop develop is sustain if it doe not disrupt the necessari condit social econom and ecolog for it continu reproduc without deplet it own basi these issu were discuss at the un confer on environ and develop in rio de janeiro brazil from 3 to 14 june 1992 sever document were approv at the confer includ the declar on environ and develop which announc the fundament principl of sustain develop these principl lie at the basi of the new russian state ecolog polici the princip object of state ecolog polici is the develop of a new legal

sectori in term of differ type of resourc licens for resourc use the implement of the principl let the pollut pay penalti and the use of natur resourc and ecosystem without deplet them reform result from the pursuit of state ecolog polici will consist in the follow the improv of environment protect law and the group of environment restrict and regul govern the use of resourc for their adapt to the condit of the more liber economi and denation properti a gradual move toward intern standard in technolog process and product creat the necessari condit for russia s inclus in the world economi

the conserv protect and reproduct of natur resourc in 1992 to a consider extent thi wa due to the insuffici effort in the past year to instal a new econom organiz mechan to monitor resourc use particularli on the region level on thi level the record and assess of natur resourc have not been organ effici yet there ha been virtual no progress in conduct a comprehens cadastr project in the

there is no technolog for process them either leak and spill of petroleum product and of fuel and lubric are a major problem in the arm forc the annual consumpt of these exce 10 million tonn most of the fuel depot and airfield were design and built in 1956 1960 and no fund have been alloc for their repair and remodel for thi reason the absenc inoper or inferior of environment protect facil in mani fuel and lubric depot can caus larg fuel leak and the pollut of surfac and ground water and contribut to the creation of larg lenticl the practic of dump unus fuel when plane come in for a land ha permeat the soil with kerosen on the ground of some airfield the sea are also be pollut by petroleum product from the ship and boat of the navi particularli near naval base although the content of

over 50 percent of the total requir just as it is in the maritim fleet novaya zemlya is suffer from a uniqu environment problem caus by militari oper it is the result of the air surfac underground and underwat nuclear test that began to be conduct here in 1957 of the creation and deploy of the fleet of atom ice breaker nuclear submarin and nuclear power surfac ship and of the dump of radioact wast
