nuclear field therefor research and develop on a broad rang of materi from structur materi to function materi and from metal to ceram is necessari ceram materi except for nuclear fuel are not at the stage of practic use for the current gener of nuclear plant howev the use of ceram as materi for specif use and function in nuclear system orient toward high temperatur such as process heat high temperatur ga cool reactor and nuclear fusion reactor ha been grow in import for instanc the follow use can be consid graphit materi for high temperatur ga cool reactor coat particl fuel and fuel for light water reactor and fast reactor solid blanket breeder materi for nuclear fusion reactor ion conduct ceram for the tritium collect system in nuclear fusion reactor and hydrogen product use nuclear heat in high temperatur ga cool reactor transluc and photo conduct ceram for the measur system in nuclear fusion reactor and semiconduct and piezoelectr ceram for robot sensor in highli radioact environ there are two way to evalu the suitabl of materi for use in the nuclear field one is to examin the adapt of candid materi to the nuclear environ by examin their adapt to the condit provid by exist data such as radiat temperatur pressur and atmospher and then confirm it by experi the other is to creat new materi suitabl for the nuclear environ by design and creat new materi to meet condit for use base on research in product structur and solid state properti and then confirm it by experi base on the recent research principl that it is necessari to consid design on the atom and molecular level to creat radiat resist ceram for nuclear use there have been a number of experi design to realiz new materi creat use molecular dynam comput simul with artifici lattic format technolog such as a molecular beam epitaxi method and to verifi the result by experi with radiat thi section introduc a number of new materi develop technolog base on nuclear reactor fuel research these includ ceram compound technolog use the sol gel process the use of transient metal carbid as ultra high temperatur materi and research on actinoid compound as part of the search for function materi the studi and use of ultra ion conductor ceram and new glass materi as well as the applic of comput simul are describ h5 1 nuclear reactor fuel and new materi h5 h5 1 fine ceram scienc and nuclear reactor fuel h5 the histori of commerci nuclear reactor fuel overlap with the histori of fine ceram scienc which began about 1950 research on the develop of uranium dioxid start in the transit period from the classic ceram industri which wa base on natur miner to the fine ceram industri which is base on characterist control compound materi and progress by absorb it result immedi in some aspect it led the fine ceram industri sinc the result of oxid fuel research which start in the unit state and britain were translat to the area of gener ceram mani of them are not inform directli a search for variou compound process composit to meet specif use condit and design and control of micro organ are requir for the develop of advanc materi research and develop of nuclear reactor fuel and fuel element is an area where these factor must be taken into account although there are option for light water reactor fuel that featur improv burn characterist plutonium recycl and burn up process there are mani aspect of oxid fuel that requir research and develop from the standpoint of new materi develop at the same time long term object beyond the current gener of light water reactor requir the elabor of nonoxid fuel nitrid carbid oxid as well as research and develop on new ceram coat materi in thi area technolog develop is in progress both for product process and character such technolog may possibl be appli to new materi develop in gener beyond nuclear reactor fuel h5 2 new develop of sol gel process h5 at present oxid fuel for light water reactor and fast reactor are produc by the powder format method howev research to simplifi thi process base on a wet method ha been conduct at variou place in conjunct with work to process collect reprocess fuel so call sol gel process wa devis at oak ridg nation research center of the unit state and began to spread to ceram product in gener a gener advantag of the sol gel process is it flexibl in manag the shape composit and properti of product thi process make it possibl to form ultra micro monodispers powder as well as rel larg integr mold piec for shape to mix compon on an extrem small scale for composit and to control densiti as well as poros for properti thi is the reason whi the sol gel process ha come to be appli extens in area outsid nuclear reactor fuel it is not easi to defin the sol gel process clearli in the narrow sens it is a process to turn 1 a suspens sol of metal compound particl as a start materi 2 into an intermedi materi by liver and 3 to acquir ceram product by burn it the method use at jaeri to compound thorium oxid fuel microspher is equival to a typic sol gel process with the method use at jaeri a thoria sol is produc by ad ammonia ga to a thorium nitrat solut a featur of thi method is to control the develop process of colloid particl in the sol by adjust the ph of the solut an effect way to prevent crack and deform of microspher by shrinkag in the subsequ gell process is to increas the size of colloid particl in the sol and to increas the colloid content figur iv 1 micro gel sphere obtain thi way are transform to high densiti microspher of tho sup 2 and th u o sub 2 by thermal process the particl size of microspher can be control by chang the drop condit such as the nozzl size particl with a diamet of sever hundr m are coat with ceram and use as coat particl fuel for high temperatur ga cool reactor smaller particl with a diamet of about 150 m figur iv 2 can be compound and use as a materi for the gel particl pressur mold method to produc high densiti pellet in the latter case dri water in gel particl after replac with alcohol produc soft microspher with a stabl pore structur use these microspher as a materi for pressur mold thorium nitrat high densiti fuel pellet over 96 percent td can be obtain at a low sinter temperatur of 1 300c in the sol gel process in a broader sens the sol stage is often omit in the case of uo sup 2 sup 2 ion a highli concentr sol cannot be form unless u sup 6 is reduc to u sup 4 therefor the nitrat solut gener is transform directli to the gel without go through the sol stage creation of viscos by ad a suitabl polym to a uranyl nitrat solut facilit the stabl format of droplet gel sphere can be obtain by process the droplet with ammonia uo sup 2 microspher to be use as coat particl fuel for high temperatur ga cool reactor are manufactur by atom fuel industri in such a process in thi method droplet are form in an ammonia ga atmospher and are gell by drop them into ammonia water thi method of work with ammonia extern is call the extern gell method as alreadi state one of the characterist of the sol gel process is eas of composit manag as an exampl of the applic of the extern gell method uo sup 2 particl supplement with zrc sic etc as oxygen getter or simul fission product have been produc experiment and have been use as fuel behavior test piec in laboratori in contrast to the extern gell method with the intern gell method gel particl are obtain by ad materi that gener ammonia when heat such as hexamethylen tetramin hmta and urea to a nitrat solut and then drop thi solut into some heat medium at jaeri the intern gell method ha been develop as a compound method for nonoxid fuel in thi case a correct amount of carbon powder is ad to the solut to obtain gel sphere that firmli combin oxid and carbon it is possibl to obtain carbid uc uc sup 2 and carbid oxid uco by heat them in a vacuum it is also possibl to obtain nitrid by heat in a nitrogen hydrogen mix stream as an option to process transuran element tru such as neptunium and americium concept for a tru annihil dispos reactor and it fuel cycl have been examin in order for annihil dispos to be valid it is essenti to minim actinid loss of the fuel cycl as a whole it is possibl to minim the loss in the fuel process stage by appli the sol gel process properli as a fuel compound method in thi case direct compound of microspher of fuel materi without involv powder is an import advantag howev applic to tru will requir experiment valid to ensur against the possibl of the stock solut becom unstabl due to heat produc by seriou _a_ decay the alkoxid gell method is a sol gel process in the broad sens and ha been note as a compound method for produc monodispers oxid powder and a special glass bodi we have develop the technolog to compound dystet transit metal carbid such as zrc tic and zrb sup 2 borid and their compound base on the alkoxid gell method metal alkoxid is hydrolyz in a carbon suspend liquid to produc a tight compound gel of oxid and carbon by heat the gel in a vacuum a soft carbon aggreg can be obtain thi aggreg can be shatter to particl with a diamet of about 100 nm by radiat it with ultrason wave for a short time an import point in it process is the select of materi to match the isoelectr point of metal oxid and carbon as well as implement hydrolysi near the isoelectr point thi make it possibl to incorpor carbon particl into the network of oxid particl transient metal carbid and borid have a number of use characterist such as high fusion point low rel densiti and high strength thu their applic can be expand to high temperatur structur materi and to coat materi micropowd with a high degre of dispers by the alkoxid gell method can be use as a materi powder for plasma coat h5 3 new type of coat particl fuel and applic h5 the basic unit of high temperatur ga cool reactor fuel is a coat fuel particl with a diamet at about 1mm each particl is an oxid fuel microspher with four layer of coat of low densiti thermal decomposit carbon high densiti thermal decomposit carbon silicon carbid sic and high densiti thermal decomposit carbon the four layer of coat serv to protect each other and also function togeth as a pressur contain for nuclear fission product for instanc the low densiti carbon layer function as a ga plenum and protect the outer layer from fission fragment the sic layer function as a diffus barrier against metal fission product such as cs and sr the coat is made by the high temperatur chemic vapor method while fuel particl are mix in a sprout bed the concept of a coat particl fuel is a technolog design to achiev high burn up at high temperatur that cannot be achiev by other fuel type and the expans of it applic to take advantag of it properti ha been examin at jaeri research and develop on a coat particl fuel with a zirconium carbid zrc layer instead of the sic layer ha been conduct the zrc coat layer is form by the reaction of zirconium halid and carbon hydrid also in the sprout bed while sic decompos in a short time at temperatur over 2 200 k zrc is hard to melt have a fusion point at 3 693 k zrc as an intermet compound of transient metal ha higher intergranular stabil than sic which ha an inher intergranular instabl as a coval compound semiconductor use of the zrc coat particl fuel in a test fuel assembl for the high temperatur engin test reactor is be consid furthermor anoth system to util the superior heat resist of zrc coat particl fuel is space nuclear reactor nuclear reactor in space can be use for power gener and propuls power for station a moon base and deep space explor process of wast heat is a big problem for space power gener reactor and improv effici in radiat cool is a key to the reduct of the system to a size appropri for space develop in the concept shown in figur iv 3 heat is led to the thermo electr convert through lithium heat pipe that are laid to a core consist of a layer fill with zrc coat fuel particl it is desir to rais the oper temperatur and therefor the fuel temperatur as much as possibl to improv radiat cool effici further nuclear heat propel rocket for man space explor requir a fuel temperatur as high as 2 400c howev in thi case the requir integr burn up time and burn up rate are smaller figur iv 4 illiter the result of heat zrc coat fuel particl produc experiment for high temperatur ga cool reactor to 2 400c after irradi although ordinari sic coat fuel particl were mostli destroy befor reach 2 400c zrc coat fuel particl were maintain at 2 400c without be damag anoth area of possibl applic of coat particl fuel is in tru extinct process the possibl of compound fuel microspher contain tru from a group separ tru salt solut by the sol gel process wa mention earlier in principl such microspher can be coat in variou way by the chemic evapor method figur iv 5 illustr a concept for the direct cool of a concentr cylind made of a metal frit net fill with fuel particl consist of tru nitrid coat with titanium nitrid nitrid is compat with metal by cool particl fuel with a larg rel surfac area fuel temperatur is kept within one third of the fuse point about 3 000 k of tru nitrid and the transfer of fission product in the fuel materi is control thi concept is design to minim the thick of the coat need to maintain sound and to achiev a hard core neutron spectrum suitabl for tru fission burn up of tru it is also intend to realiz high output densiti or high nuclear transfer speed by cool the particl directli h5 4 actinid compound h5 the difficulti in predict the behavior of actinid solid is close relat to the behavior of the 5f electron thi is becaus the degre of the effect of the 5f electron on linkag differ depend on the specif actinid element other element use for alloy and compound and environment condit such as temperatur and pressur actinid can be divid roughli into two group from th to pu and am and beyond in mani way actinid beyond am are similar to lanthanid although the concept of group separ as well as extinct process of tru ha been examin at variou place it is note that np and am the main compon of wast tru are veri differ from each other in their characterist in the examin of fuel and target tru nitrid as well as alloy is one of the hope candid for tru extinct process fuel the reason is that while actinid are extrem variabl in their characterist as individu metal and it is difficult to predict their behavior nitrid are expect to share their characterist therefor the databas for un and u pu n is expect to be use to predict the behavior of nitrid fuel contain tru to a certain degre howev there is no suffici databas for un and u pu n at present there is a cooper project between jaeri and pnc on irradi test for u pu n fuel use the joyo reactor a product technolog for compound nitrid pellet base on a powder method ha almost been complet build on thi technolog research on npn compound ha begun concern the basic solid state properti for nitrid thermal diffus rate measur and vapor pressur measur are in progress the evapor behavior of individu nitrid is rel simpl as un ha a lower u partial pressur than n sup 2 partial pressur nitrogen is lost with prioriti and a metal liquid phase is separ at high temperatur over 1 700c even though the evapor behavior of these nitrid compound is complex a precis understand is requir sinc the appear of the liquid phase temperatur defin the maximum fuel line output use the measur result from laboratori and refer inform we have establish a system to implement routin multipl compound multipl phase equilibrium analysi figur iv 6 illustr the result of an evapor behavior analysi for u pu n we plan to further develop the databas for actinid alloy ceram and fuse salt along with the increas in burn up rate and burn up ratio of plutonium the densiti of preciou metal fission product in spent fuel increas radic compar to the convent fuel in some condit an alloy phase such as u pu pd sup 3 may appear and becom a problem in reprocess due to it refractori properti research on actinid inter metal compound is an import item for futur research certain type of actinid inter metal compound are

variou solid state properti of these materi are close relat to their structur and a studi of their structur properti is the most basic research object in examin the properti of these materi as experiment mean of structur analysi such method as x ray and neutron ray diffractometri laser raman spectroscopi and infrar spectroscopi are commonli use howev with these method it is difficult to obtain binari distribut function between the constitu atom except for special element on the other hand it is extrem use to appli molecular dynam comput simul which ha made rapid progress recent to these random system for instanc although it requir massiv amount of time and money to obtain the solid state properti of fuse salt onli from experi supplement such effort with comput simul help predict an optimum materi system with target properti valu in thi section we will discuss ultra ion conduct materi as exampl of ceram function materi as well as research on fluorid glass which is use in the infrar rang and structur properti evalu by molecular dynam comput simul as exampl of random system h5 1 ultra ion conduct materi h5 there are materi that are solid and capabl of transfer onli

the cathod in the form of vapor an electrolyt reaction on the cathod side reduc the water and hydrogen ga is separ gener oxygen ion are transfer through the electrolyt and becom oxygen ga be oxid on the cathod side therefor when vapor is suppli to one side of a ceram barrier to becom electrolyz vapor and a hydrogen compound ga are obtain and on the other side oxygen ga is obtain research and develop for the revers process of thi system is also in progress thi ha rais some interest nuclear relat topic exemplifi the chang in approach to variou research activ figur iv 8 illustr the hydrogen convers rate for vapor as a function of temperatur and electrolyt voltag in the ideal condit of no intern resist in the electrolyt cell when respond to tritium hydrolysi in the fuel circul system for
