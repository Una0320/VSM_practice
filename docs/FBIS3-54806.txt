languag f p 105 english f articl type bfn f p 106 exclus report no 1 51 of 30 decemb f text thi parliament will be difficult to work with say anatoliy sobchak the mayor of st petersburg and a member of russia s new parliament anatoliy sobchak is a lead polit figur in hi countri he may be expect to run for presid in three year from now at least he ha said noth to rule out the possibl a petersburg base report for interfax ha approach sobchak with a few question on the outcom of the decemb 12 parliamentari elect anatoliy sobchak i believ both russian and european polit leader must draw lesson from the result of the elect nation coupl with militar alway equal fascism and nation root in the complic problem odf the russian arm forc and militari industri complex is rais head in russia today thi come as no surpris now that nationalist tendenc are grow in all the post communist countri the west ha even support and hail the bloom of nation in the baltic republ and ukrain becaus it produc the breakup of the soviet union now that the russian have respond with a nation of their own mani are feel flabbergast i am convinc howev that the democrat forc will meet the outcom of the elect with seriou polit action that all the democrat forc will join hand becaus let me make it clear onc again russian nation in it present guis translat into fascism if do you feel the result of the parliamentari elect will move the russian govern to make seriou chang in it econom and foreign polici anatoliy sobchak that wa a question you d better address to the presid and govern although i feel the govern can t help amend it polici it must among other thing concentr on a thought out foreign strategi which would take into consider the russian nation interest especi in relat with the former soviet republ prioriti must be chang in domest polici a new approach must be taken to relat with the constitu part of the feder and more attent must be paid to the russian interest although not at the expens of the right and interest of other peopl on the feder s territori if be a lawyer how do you feel about the possibl of opposit to the major in parliament anatoliy sobchak the feder assembl ha neither major nor minor forc as yet the parliament is divid more or less accur into the democrat and those who may eventu emerg as the opposit those who are customarili describ as the independ make up approxim one third of the lawmak and have yet to defin their polit view besid all the parti and bloc have yet to matur into full size polit unit mani of them were found the last moment befor the elect and who can tell whether part of their repres won t decid to join other parti or bloc russia s new parliament is so far unpredicatbl it would be a mistak to say out of hand that antidemocrat forc are command a major in the new legislatur if one made that mistak those who have yet to defin their posit would be prompt to join that major so i see the need for seriou and veri flexibl tactic real parliamentar transit to normal profession parliamentari work will rid russian parliamentar of the infantil disord of the defunct suprem soviet the transit howev will take a lot of effort becaus most member of the feder assembl have no experi of law make thi will be sure to influenc veri serious the effect of their perform and their divis into parliamentari faction as well as the format of ad hoc coalit in other word i feel thi parliament will be veri difficult to work with it may be expect to confront both the presid and govern with mani problem especi if neither bori yeltsin nor the nation cabinet draw lesson from the outcom of the recent held elect if russia s partner in europ have voic seriou concern about the outcom of the elect anatoliy sobchak everyon is concern about the outcom of the russian elect europ even more so that russia the parti win the elect on parti ticket whose leader say he is not go to think twice about put to use a few dozen nuclear devic just to make germani or ukrain or kazakhstan submit to russia vladimir zhirinovskiy of the liber democrat parti if the european can t help take such statement close to heart now that they especi germani have alreadi met with thi kind of leader mani rememb that no one in germani gave seriou thought to hitler s first call for expand eastward hitler wa made fun of he wa a laugh stock in germani with the result that europ and somewhat later the world as a whole were plung into the bloodiest of all war so the western concern about what is happen in russia is understand if the commiss of big europ could in all likelihood emerg as a mechan for fight thi threat anatoliy sobchak there is no doubt of that as a veri strong mechan i would say the commiss must play a role in the effort to achiev polit uniti in europ and map out one blueprint and concert strategi for foght nation and fascism in russia and other countri of europ the problem of nation is press on everyon includ the untroubl belgium britain and spain it is sit on everyon s agenda explos are heard and other terrorist action are be carri out h3 gener baskayev russia s militari doctrin leav much room for controversi h3 now that the situat in russia is fairli complic the intern troop of the countri s ministri of intern affair are emerg as a guarantor for domest stabil the command of the intern troop moscow district and the man who act as the militari command of russia s white hous dure the octob develop in moscow major gener arkadiy baskayev and viktor akimov of interfax are focus on the condit and futur of those troop if the district under your command is not onli central but the biggest in russia arkadiy baskayev the moscow district of the intern troop is one of the biggest among the feder s nine such district it unit are deploy in 16 region of central russia but the north caucasian district is the biggest of all if what character the state off affair in the unit under your command part of the men are be demobil and new forc are join the unit arkadiy baskayev the situat is complic first of all there are problem with the draft some armi commissariat are unabl to meet the draft quota on the whole men are enlist onli thank to our offic effort offic meet with the mother of our futur troop brief them on the condit of servic and make them feel beeter as a result there are no awol case on the other hand we are receiv weak boy whose height and weight are under the norm from the veri first day we are offer them extra ration to be abl to work them basic train in the intern troop is differ from basic train in other unit armi commissariat are to select boy for our oper and motor unit in a bid to insur the better physic condit and higher moral of our recruit our men are commit to action in variou part of thi countri and under especi complic if not extrem condit if how do armi commissariat select recruit arkadiy baskayev offic of the intern troop sit on the commissariat panel to find out more about the drafte s interest and favorit sport men with a crimin record are not accept if what about the drafte s weight and height arkadiy baskayev we use to pay attent to that now that we are face problem with draft we pay no attnet to that if we have draft a suffici number of men we ourselv take care of that problem incident the same armi commissariat are in charg of draft men to the intern troop and the arm forc under the defens ministri there are draft quota if how mani boy appear unabl to meet your requir and drop out of your unit arkadiy baskayev practic none these day which doe not mean everyon cope those who fail to cope are transfer to our logist unit if what about the offic or those who have come to serv under a contract arkadiy baskayev unfortun we are face even more problem with the offic than with the men under their command we are lose a grow number of career servicemen owe to the shortag of hous facil and low payment what a commiss offic earn today an averag of 120 000 roubl a month is no money commerci structur lure intern troop offic to serv as their secur men a deputi compani command is offer 500 000 to 600 000 roubl a month and currenc bonus so far our men have by and larg been reject such job proposit but are begin to yield to pressur under the exist legal regul i have no right to reject a serviceman s request for the sever of hi contract as a result there s a shortag of compani and platoon command in the intern troop we are serious worri about thi draft are a success onli in the provinc unit of the intern troop in the provinc are work under regular organiz chart those who have sign up to serv under a contract make up 96 percent of our regiment in the citi of briansk in moscow howev and other citi veri few men are sign up to serv under a contract hous present a veri difficult problem if a short while ago the media accus you of resort to forc in the attempt to resolv thi problem a residenti project wa seiz arkadiy baskayev the hous problem is one of the most press onli in moscow more than 500 commiss and non commiss offic have nowher to live my deputi in the rank of gener down to commiss and non commiss offic with a seven to eight year length of servic are live in dormitori onli men who have serv at least five year with the intern troop are regard as those without hous facil and are place on a hous list not so long ago the district bought 14 apart in a residenti project built by veteran of the war in afghanistan the famili of offic who move into those flat use to live in emerg condit without heat and ga we had to posit our men around the hous becaus peopl who describ themselv as refuge start move in without ani legal reason for it we were allow in onli those who could prove their right to live in that hous i wa surpris and veri angri when sever mediaa edit start twist fact to accus the intern troop of the arbitrari arm seizur of hous facil repeat in full keep with law and in line with an appropri formal agreement we bought and are protect hous facil for our homeless offic if you are a career offic with a lengthi servic record even though the intern troop will not be act directli under the recent adopt militari doctrin what is your view of the doctrin arkadiy baskayev in my view it leav much room for controversi on the one hand the russian arm forc are adopt a total new strategi and on the other the troop are unabl to meet their new object i think thought must be given to thi incident there is a clear cut strategi for the intern troop and prospect are clear for their advanc instead of guard penitentiari the intern troop will be enegag primarili in oper assign onli polic forc will from now on be use as prison guard there will be no more soldier atop the penitentiari observ tower the intern troop are to help the polic to enforc law and order especi in the area under a state of emerg say ossetia and ingushetia russian republ where inter ethnic tension is run extrem high in the northern caucasu if and to act hand in hand with the polic to fight crime the elit brigad quarter in sofrino near moscow ha alreadi been commit to action in thi kind of oper in moscow i see the result as good if what exactli is the sofrino brigad arkadiy baskayev it wa form in octob or novemb of 1988 it took part in the enforc of law and order in tbilisi and baku in 1989 by 1991 it had been engag in the effort to disengag the conflict parti in nagorni karabakh and in 1992 1993 it wa use to insur secur in the area of interethn conflict in the northern caucasu more than 200 of it commiss and non commiss offic have receiv govern award for the role they play in the octob develop in moscow as of date all it men are stay in sofrino they are undergo combat and special train as well as men of ani other unit they are expect to know how to use differ kind of arm and they may be engag in street fight and will be expect to know how to use plastic shield and polic truncheon and they may be commit to action under emerg condit if back to the octob develop in moscow what lesson did you a command with a combat record draw from them arkadiy baskayev the main lesson i am draw from them is thi all polit problem must be resolv by polit mean by way of negoti without drag the militari includ the intern troop into attempt to settl differ as soon as the militari come to play a role blood is shed on the other hand i am sure a civil war wa avert in octob if the confront had continu the countri woul ve split into two camp thank god that wa avert if wa there an altern to the militari action arkadiy baskayev i don t think there wa procrastin would ve led to a civil war law and order forc were act without hesit as well as the intern troop they abid by the law and in full recognit of realiti there wa no altern to what they did on octob 3 and 4 if wa the use of tank fulli justifi arkadiy baskayev in my view their experi and technic mean at their dispos enabl the intern troop to seiz control of build without the use of tank h5 aleksandr rutskoy did not vote h5 yuriy ivanov the legal counsel of former russian vice presid aleksandr rutskoy relat to interfax exclus what hi client had to say about the result of recent elect abov all rutskoy did not vote becaus he believ that a coup wa stage in the countri and the legal basi decre by yeltsin for the constitut reform wa a sham the report of hi vote were untru he also understand that the disband and shell of the countri s top legislatur and it defend brought about a hopeless situat which could onli be aggrav if there wa no parliament at all in rutskoy s view the elect result are signific and instruct in hi view construct patriot forc must make certain conclus becaus the nearli 50 percent of the elig voter who did not go to the poll station lost faith in the abil of the present leader to chang the situat in the countri for the better seriou work is need with these russian and those who are still naiv optimist about pseudo democrat and radic reform rutskoy appreci the posit of the voter who reject the bankrupt presidenti polici and those who grab power for the sole purpos of dismantl the countri and plung the russian peopl into mud the peopl saw through defend of the peopl such as russia s choic pre and the democrat russia movement and depriv them from a clear victori so much await by yeltsin rutskoy attribut the success of the ldpr and it leader zhirinovskiy to the well plan elector campaign and clear present of their polit platform they succeed in persuad the russian that the parti did not want their vote for selfish purpos but sincer want to do someth for the sake of the russian state and the impoverish and hunt down russian peopl in the ldpr platform the russian idea sound convinc against the background of lie perpetu by democrat about anti crisi polici and success in counter inflat it is a piti that the peopl did not fulli understand who drove the countri into thi crisi the former vice presid note that all post elector groan about zhirinovskiy s domin of the tv and radio time are ridicul he could hear one of moscow radio program in hi prison cell and he found that most of the radio time wa taken up by interview and program with govern and other pseudo democrat who were brainwash the popul rutskoy think that zhirinovskiy must be thank to gentlemen democrat for the shell of the parliament build and bar the nation salvat front the russian all popular union the russian christian democrat movement and other patriot movement from the elect the good show of the russian communist parti which ha gotten rid of variou opportunist especi signific in the light of what the communist movement ha been through over the last two year rutskoy think he believ that the parti will increas it popular if it pursu an intellig polici of defend the nation interest for the sake of the state and the peopl in rutskoy s view the agrarian parti could do even better he wish that parti well and is sincer glad that it will have a larg parliamentari represent and thi will help the parti to gain even larger support rutskoy want to congratul the parti and it leader lapshin on their victori by the latest report the parti won 4 261 398 vote or 7 90 percent if rutskoy also congratul the russia s women bloc which he is confid will vigor protect the right of the better half of the russian popul and the interest of the famili and child rutskoy denounc the flagrant duplic of democrat in particular the kozyrev poltoranin shumeyko and other who are now publicli woo those whom they call fascist and red and brown as recent as a month ago two week ago rutskoy say kozyrev demand ban the communist parti but now he is prepar to alli with it thi the former vice presid think is a classic case of the eas with which such politico are sold and bought should we not expect statement about the import of joint action with communist from peopl such as novodvorskaya bonner popov yakunin and sobchak communist he think must be especi cautiou in deal with such new friend and rememb that peopl of thi kind are the worst anti communist rutskoy wa glad that lipitskiy and other civic union figur had a measur of support even though the result fell short of the expect he object to use the term fascism in describ zhirinovskiy and the million of russian who vote for the ldpr becaus that would offend a major part of the elector rutskoy emphas that fascism and fascist are those who order build a barb wire fenc around the hous of soviet and shell parliament for the whole world to see he recal that one salient featur of fascism wa legal authoritarian rule and run the countri by decre rather than by decis made by democrat elect bodi
