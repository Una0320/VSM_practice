languag f p 105 japanes f articl type cso text the handl of high grade plutonium come from the dismantl of nuclear weapon from the former soviet union ha becom a big issu and the japan atom energi research institut jaeri ha almost complet basic research on a onc through type plutonium fuel in which pu239 is 99 percnt burn and annihil in exist light water reactor lwr and the spent fuel also will have almost the same stabil as natur ore jaeri explain the result of it research to the japan atom energi commiss jaec the plutonium from dismantl which is said to be about 200 ton is about 94 percnt pu239 and whether to util thi for peac use or put them under storag and control ha becom a topic of intern debat sinc jaeri s onc through type fuel can be manufactur easili in exist fuel fabric plant without dilut and almost 100 percnt of the pu239 can be annihil without build a separ mono fuel combust reactor it probabl will draw intern interest as well jaeri emphas three point in it research 1 the fuel should be onc through type and the spent fuel should becom high level wast while kept in coat pipe and not have to be reprocess or solidifi 2 from the viewpoint of stabil of wast and use of fuel manufactur technolog the fuel should be an oxid base and 3 for purpos of safeti the fusion point of the fuel should be 2 000 deg or more from thi viewpoint two type of fluorit oxid fuel have been nomin for a fuel with irradi stabil and fission product solid solubl and stabil 1 thoria base compound of plutonium thorium and alumina and 2 zirconia gadolinia base compound of plutonium zirconium gadolinium and alumina data show that 99 percnt annihil of nuclear weapon grade pu239 at about 60 000 mwd ton burnup wa achiev for both type in term of void coeffici howev the thoria base fuel wa neg wherea the zirconia gadolinia base fuel wa posit or greater excess reaction with thi fuel to increas plutonium burnup the greater the proport of cool water to the cubic volum of reactor fuel the better therefor exist lwr with a 1 9 ratio or the vver 1000 are better than fast reactor and becaus fast reactor also have the characterist of not burn up pu239 the lwr is more advantag in practic applic of thi fuel although a high temperatur ga reactor could be use it plutonium load is about 2 ton and it cannot burn more than the lwr s 6 ton moreov with onc through fuel the spent fuel ha more weather stabil than glassifi wast after reprocess and can be buri as is radioact is about the same it is also maintain that thi fuel can be manufactur in exist facil becaus it is an oxid jaeri alreadi ha complet the basic studi and plan to continu research to find the optimum composit for the fuel the purpos of the onc through type fuel is burnup and annihil of high grade 94 percnt pure plutonium and it is not directli applic to japan s fuel recycl system howev the scienc and technolog agenc is hope that thi effect technolog will be one option for the peac use of plutonium from dismantl howev jaeri plan to unveil it at the 7th intern confer on innov nuclear energi system which will begin on 20 septemb at the makuhari in tokyo
