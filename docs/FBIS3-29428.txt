the south korean author nuclear weapon develop programm under a south korean canadian decemb 1974 contract the wolsong phwr project began in januari 1976 and went into oper in april 1983 at present south korea ha the wolsong phwr the multi purpos research reactor k nrr and post irradi test facil in oper as an integr centr of the plutonium product the amount of nuclear materi from a 1 000 mwe megawatt electr phwr after one year oper is enough to manufactur around 50 atom bomb of nagasaki type therefor it follow that the 678 7 mwe phwr oper in south korea sinc 1983 ha by now produc potenti plutonium enough to manufactur over 370 atom bomb the u s newspap intern herald tribun on novemb 2 1993 said that south korea is speed up it ambiti nuclear programm under iaea safeguard and further wrote that expert estim that it accumul spent fuel would yield about 10 ton of plutonium if reprocess thi stockpil of potenti plutonium will increas to an estim 24 ton by the year 2 000 thi wa point out also by the japanes magazin sekai in it decemb issu of 1992 which report that south korea ha stockpil about 10 ton of plutonium extract from the spent fuel quit obviou is how much the stockpil of plutonium will bulk up when anoth phwr now under construct is commiss into oper south korea is speed up it project to build more phwr in an effort to extract more plutonium under the pretext of

south korean offici ad at the same meet that south korea would like to reprocess lwr spent fuel for recycl plutonium back into these phwr the point at issu is that the spent nuclear fuel from the phwr

stark fact that the persist dustup by the south korean author over the dprk s so call suspect nuclear programm is after all intend to justifi their attempt to develop nuclear weapon comment on thi the

develop the canada base oversea korean newspap new korea time comment on octob 23 1993 that particularli the voic of the new right wing forc in south korea call for the possess of nuclear weapon wa high in intens and the opposit respons wa no less tough as if reflect such pro and con south korea s nuclear independ turn out to be a favorit topic in the nation assembl as well these fact alon suffic to show that the south korean author are dash headlong toward nuclear weapon develop unconcern with the joint declar on the denuclear of the korean peninsula which they have now render worthless the south korean author must renounc their nuclear weapon develop polici for the denuclearis of the korean peninsula remov the nuclear materi they have alreadi produc or brought from other
