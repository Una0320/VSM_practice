lui guillermo angel restrepo and the medellin peopl aim at clear up the death of antioquia governor antonio roldan betancur h5 what the futur hold h5 there are those who thought that julio fabio urdinola s present on saturday would be follow by a truce in the war between the govern and the prosecutor gener s offic howev earli statement by the prosecutor gener and the presid made it quit clear that such would not be the case de greiff hasten to say he hope that what had happen would end the govern s hysteria while gaviria said urdinola s surrend wa a veri good thing to consolid the polici of surrend but that it would in no way fix thing with the prosecutor gener whatev the case the countri can learn sever lesson from what ha happen the first of these is that these thing occur when legisl is draft that give rise to ambigu as wa the case last year with the code of crimin procedur a matter on which both the prosecutor gener s offic and the govern were in agreement ambigu legisl give rise to interpret as contradictori as those now made by both the execut branch and the prosecutor gener on standard to be appli in the case of the surrend of the cali cartel the second great lesson is that in a countri that ha suffer from drug traffick for so mani year cooper between govern and legal author is not onli desir but absolut necessari howev much the prosecutor gener may claim that the agenc under hi tutelag is autonom and that colombia ha a separ of power articl 113 of the 1991 constitut state that the differ organ of govern have separ function but will cooper harmoni to achiev their goal if thi must be so in ani one field it is in the fight against drug traffick where victori have been obtain onli when the differ organ of govern have work shoulder to shoulder that is whi in addit to be indispens cooper between the govern and the prosecutor gener s offic is vital two entiti detach from the govern the polic and da must do the work of secur and intellig and the prosecutor gener s offic must use that inform and make it judici use through inpec which fall under the ministri of justic the govern must guarante that those arrest and convict must go to prison other agenc of govern are involv in the process howev the arm forc as a whole in the seizur of shipment the fac colombian air forc and aerocivil with respect to plane use in traffick and the superintend of bank and exchang with respect to drug traffick money launder for all of these reason entrench such as that of gustavo de greiff with respect to the autonomi of the prosecutor gener s offic can be valid from the legal standpoint but mistaken in practic someth similar can be said about cooper with the govern of the unit state howev much it may displeas mani nationalist colombian washington is colombia s main partner in the fight against drug and to break with that countri can be as costli as do so in the commerci or polit field whatev the case as confirm by statement made follow urdinola s surrend the confront ha appar reach the point of no return it is too earli to say which of the two camp is ahead in the public opinion poll the prosecutor gener s offic ha lost much of the prestig it enjoy sever month ago as shown by recent poll even so howev de greiff continu to enjoy great credibl if he doe not want to lose it he will have to demonstr that the busi he propos with the peopl of cali is not onli good for that citi but right for societi the prosecutor gener s offic will have to compil proof and reconstruct solid case against those newli surrend if it doe not do so not onli will the prosecutor gener and hi offic lose respect but the greatest judici reform of contemporari colombia establish of the accusatori system will be on the verg of collaps
