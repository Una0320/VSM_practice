there have been u s demand which have been somewhat imposs but noth like numer target which he said clearli run counter to market principl and deregul thi approach he maintain destroy the basic human

close hatakeyama went on to say that presid clinton s statement after the februari summit that japan is the most close market of the g 7 countri is a misinterpret of japan s manufactur market he said there are three factor which determin whether a market is open or close water s edg govern regul which restrict import or author import tariff domest regul which standard and certifi environment

onli a 20 percent of the japanes market these number are correct note hatakeyama but the u s share of japan s semiconductor market is so small onli becaus japan ha strong highli competit compani in it
