candid and it is highli unlik that thi wa a surpris to ani of them nevertheless four of them refus to stand top of the list wa zhirinovskiy who use hi allot few minut on the platform to issu insult and threat against hi rival zhirinovskiy s reason for hi withdraw wa he said hi unwilling to work as a traffic control thi argument doe not stand up to critic the chairman of the liber democrat parti of russia ldpr himself could not stand for the post of parliament s traffic control but ani other member of that faction could howev the awesom ldpr is clearli not overendow with potenti speaker the experi with georgiy lukava whom zhirinovskiy had alreadi tri to direct from the provinc demonstr that the chairman s place must be occupi by someon who is at least more compet is there one in the ldpr if there is will he not use the protect of the independ guarante by the post of speaker to move away from the fuehrer s influenc thu split the falang and creat a second center of graviti in it zhirinovskiy undoubtedli ask himself these question befor take the platform but they were meaningless in view of the main fact that today an ldpr candid ha no real chanc of put togeth either a rel or even less an absolut major in the duma that is whi the faction s gener secretari gave the order to support a differ candid yuriy vlasov it soon emerg thi is also interest becaus zhirinovskiy decid to back not a weak and ultim manag candid but a strong and probabl unmanag candid anatoliy lukyanov appar wa the onli candid who withdrew honor becaus he wa tire and we forgiv him thi littl ruse which is that he did not ask nevzorov to simpli not nomin him the same cannot be said about valentin kovalev a nonparti candid from ot the communist parti who withdrew hi candidaci befor the vote in favor of ivan rybkin the nomine from the agrarian parti which wa clearli agre in advanc the reason for the withdraw of sergey shakhray a politician skill in affair of thi kind are not so simpl he clearli realiz that neither he nor ani other member of hi faction had a chanc of make a breakthrough in the first round but he ha hardli abandon the idea of occupi the speaker s chair onc and for all most probabl shakhray like the women of russia faction weigh the situat up and came to the conclus that the first round of vote would not bring anyon success and that therefor it wa better not to enter the fray until round two the elect speech of the remain candid were similar in that everyon with the except of yuriy vlasov who had bluntli state to the russia s choic repres in the hall i have oppos you and will continu to do so tri to emphas their commit to parliamentar and respect for the right of minor and to a greater or lesser extent declar that they would be apolit if elect to the post of chairman of the chamber for all the crafti greater or lesser depend on the candid of these assur they can all serv as testimoni to the fact that the guid principl of the deputi corp when compar with the suprem soviet have inde switch to some extent from polit confront toward the idea of cooper and a desir for compromis in the spirit of true parliamentar the finest and most tragic perform as a candid speaker wa undoubtedli the rearguard action fought by sergey kovalev soberli assess the potenti of it faction russia s choic decid not to nomin from it exist reserv a candid whose chanc of success look more realist sergey kovalev a man who is by no mean as naiv as some of hi oppon would arrogantli like to think ascend the platform like golgotha and as expect wa insult by the mob use the term here in the sens that even the most respect and highli organ meet can turn into a mob at time and fulli demonstr the mean of the command to turn the other cheek understand in the tabl of the overal weight vote reytingovoy golosovaniy kovalev wa second from last 138 vote but third from bottom wa vladimir medvedev leader of the new region polici faction form the day befor and consist of independ deputi and thi rate demonstr more the inabl of the democrat faction to carri out organiz work in the parliament the 15 minut recess befor the vote i felt could have substanti alter that result and possibl have taken medvedev into the semifin as an altern to the communist ivan rybkin as these note are be made up for print the finalist on the platform at the former cema build will be ivan rybkin 233 vote and yuriy vlasov 200 vote who in the polit sens are certainli not altern to one anoth it is possibl to forecast with a good deal of confid although by the time thi newspap is sign to print thi result will be known accur that neither of the contend will secur 223 simpl zavetnyy vote in a convent rather than a weight ballot under the rate vote it is possibl to support sever candid and thu if you consid the overal disposit of the three major bloc the vote of the democrat the day befor becam black ball for the two finalist while the vote of the communist and zhirinovskiy s support were white ball again for both candid in the final howev complic by the secret procedur of vote via booth when you can onli vote for one or the other alternativno rybkin must lose the vote of the ldpr faction and vlasov the vote of the communist we can take the length of time that the duma need to collect 223 vote for a candid speaker as a measur to some extent of the standard of it parliamentar take thi term to mean first and foremost the abil to move toward a mutual construct compromis which take into account the right of minor at the moment the duma is split into three part in which each of the three sector with less than 50 percent is in the minor no matter what the disposit of forc is in the near futur under the catalyz influenc of the process of elect of the speaker in the duma a fourth quit power sector will be structur and it seem that thi faction will be the new region polici it is seek to occupi the polit center where it can absorb shakhray s parti of russian uniti and accord becaus of a coincid of main program aim and becom a center of attract for other small associ of deputi and independ deputi clearli russia s polit destini will depend to a consider extent on whether thi new polit forc oper as a center right or center left organ
