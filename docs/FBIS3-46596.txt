at our daili live peopl resid in local area complain that they have fewer job opportun than those resid in urban area and they feel that the cultur and educ level in their local area is low mani urban

possibl of rais the pave road rate in rural villag to that in medium citi build an effici high speed traffic network which link major local citi with each other by highway rail and air is essenti to turn our nation into a multipolar and diversifi land for exampl i intend to enabl 98 percent of the popul to arriv in interchang within one hour by extend the current 6 000 km of the superhighway

will aim for comfort commut in urban area by improv the rail servic and construct quadrupl track rail line doubl track go in each direct in urban area in thi way i intend to upgrad the peopl s live infrastructur third i would like to mention the build of a comprehens and characterist societi when i think of the futur world i believ that the full growth of diversifi charact will give rise to uniqu cultur and econom activ which will in return becom a sourc of new vital thi is an import element for japan to act as a respons member of the intern commun and contribut to the commun from that point of view i believ that my govern should strive to promot research in high technolog in which japan is said to lag behind other nation i think that to that end it is necessari to promot basic research in the area of space life materi and energi i intend to give budgetari prioriti to import research and develop program to prepar japan for the 21st centuri while seek to consolid the infrastructur to train outstand research and upgrad research facil regard the promot of cultur and art i plan to foster young artist who will bear the futur of japan s art increas subsidi to uniqu local cultur activ and build a societi where cultur prosper at the same time it is import to creat a climat wherein japan can freeli talk with other nation and they can understand each other s divers from that point i plan to promot truli meaning intern exchang under which japan accept 100 000 foreign student for studi here next there is the inform industri which may be a typic exampl of an econom area fill with creativ thank to fast progress in inform commun technolog it will becom possibl earli in the 21st centuri for peopl to watch program all over the world at ani time and to even receiv medic and administr servic at home it will becom necessari to push for overal deregul of the commun sector to enabl acceler improv of exist network and the launch of new project by privat busi but it is never easi to realiz such an invigor and abund societi it take so mani financi resourc to implement social secur program and to improv social overhead capit while aim to creat a creativ fill societi no doubt necessari cost and respons should be share among us in a fair and appropri manner without that it will be imposs to realiz the societi we seek to be in by the 21st centuri to ensur that societi doe not lose it vital from high tax burden we are resolv to contain the peopl s burden to below 50 percent even at the age popul s peak time in the 21st centuri we must think hard and come up with the best possibl idea we must implement administr reform with an emphasi on deregul as well as fundament revis of govern expenditur my govern should boldli relax regul which will gener the maximum effect in area close tie to peopl s live like distribut hous and land new type of busi like inform commun and industri which will contribut to expand employ even when these effort are made howev i think that if an abund and invigor societi is to be realiz in the 21st centuri some increas in individu tax burden will be unavoid right now one senior citizen is support by five work citizen but when our age societi peak one senior citizen will be support by onli two work citizen simpli put the burden will more than doubl no doubt we must also think about increas social secur insur premium with a further age popul and increas tax burden to improv social overhead capit if we look at the exist tax system from such a viewpoint becaus the weight of individu incom tax in the tax system is so larg so much of the burden need to be born by the gener of work peopl if the present condit is allow to continu it will excess task the gener support the age societi if the willing of the work gener and the vigor of the societi as a whole are to be fulli maintain it will becom necessari to reconsid the burden of the peopl and to bring a tax system which ensur a balanc between incom consumpt and asset as such i have come to think the best choic given to us is to push for a tax system reform with a nation consensu along the line of the tax reform polici recommend by the tax commiss which is aim at realiz a fair and invigor societi of the age popul i would like to have the nation s understand on thi lastli i would like to speak about intern affair japan s prosper is onli possibl if the world s free trade system is maintain i believ that the recent conclus of the uruguay round is truli signific it is a matter of cours for my govern to give full consider to the impact of the round s conclus in particular my govern will take measur to enabl farmer to engag in farm free of concern i believ the govern must take measur to ensur the futur of the farmer and thu prevent the nation s food self suffici rate from further drop listen to voic from other nation japan is still close japan s save are too high while it invest are too small japan is critic for that needless to say some of such critic is base on misunderstand but we have to vigor improv what need to be improv the aggress upgrad of the current infrastructur to prepar for a societi of senior citizen is not for the sake of other nation but for the sake of ourselv to do that we need to secur revenu resourc which will not leav excess burden to the futur gener onc that is done i think we will have to review the basic plan on public work invest includ possibl revis and increas of the invest alloc i am convinc that we will be abl to build japan s econom societi into one that is open to other nation through the cours of implement those polici of cours the econom and social reform be propos here are not someth that can be done by the govern alon and all reform accompani pain besid the choic we can take are veri limit i hope we will be abl to challeng difficulti with the cooper of the peopl and build an age which is full of ideal of hope by share pain among all of us with the so call econom bubbl have gone and with inventori have undergon readjust thi is the year when the economi should recov in full scale i am confid that we will have a good econom new year if we move toward the vision present today while do the best in overcom the immedi issu of the economi i pray that thi year may be a fruit year for all of you the peopl of the nation thank you report then we would like to begin ask question first mr prime minist i would like to ask thi question in connect with the vision you talk about just now talk about the tax system reform you have said that the reform would not mean simpli rais or lower tax rate and that you would present a vision so i assum the vision you mention today is the vision you have said wa forthcom bluntli put can i say that you are ask the peopl to understand that an increas in the consumpt tax is unavoid hosokawa no i did not mean to refer to the consumpt tax rate issu the vision for the 21st centuri is as the word say the vision for the 21st centuri i present a long term view on what the futur econom societi should look like with the age popul an increas in tax burden is unavoid if we choos to avoid increas burden then we will have no choic but to reduc social secur benefit on the other hand if we choos to reli on debt while that may be all right with the peopl of our gener it will result in leav mani burden to our children and grandchildren if the work gener bear excess burden with the popul age proceed there will aris the question of whether societi s vital can be maintain or the question of whether the work gener will not lose their will to work despit that when we think about thi point it becom clear we have to consid as point out in the tax commiss s recommend and the hiraiwa commiss s report about the relationship between the interest and burden of the peopl and about the tax system which can ensur balanc between incom asset and consumpt as such i present in the vision my view on how the peopl s interest and benefit should be balanc report i would like to ask onc again today you said you will push for an overal tax system reform base on the nation consensu could you have use that express with the reduct of incom tax and the increas of consumpt tax in the futur in mind hosokawa i may be repeat what i said just now with the age societi arriv an increas in burden will be unavoid i think it will be irrespons to avoid bear the increas burden the consult committe of the govern and rule parti is now discuss what specif we should do from a broad perspect in consider of the tax commiss s recommend by the time the 1994 budget is formul in mid or late januari the committe will come up with a conclus the govern will make a decis after see the committe s conclus report you did not make yourself clear on the question of the consumpt tax increas but accord to the vision you present you want to go for an overal tax system reform base on the tax commiss s recommend i think it is clear what you want to say realli wa that there is no choic but to rais the consumpt tax rate in the futur the reason you cannot speak clearli about it is becaus the social democrat parti of japan sdpj is strongli oppos to it i would like to ask if you can convinc the sdpj hosokawa that is a tough question i think there are sever prerequisit for promot a comprehens tax system reform for exampl we must ration expenditur and correct unfair practic in taxat among these prerequisit a drastic review of the balanc between direct and indirect tax is one of the biggest issu relat to the nation s comprehens tax reform regard the govern s conclus on the issu howev i must repeat that is still under debat among the coalit parti the consult committe compos of all parti is discuss the matter sinc the burden are unavoid i think the committe will come to some sort of conclus report mr prime minist it seem your statement today focus on mid and long term govern task howev in your new year s statement i think the public want to hear your stanc toward emerg pump prime measur what is your actual plan for the new pump prime packag hosokawa with respect to econom measur the govern ha alreadi hammer out sever pump prime packag and through the third supplementari budget for fiscal 1993 and the initi budget for fiscal 1994 we are go to implement ceaseless econom stimulu measur to cover the come 15 month our budget formul work give much consider to stimul of the economi and it will certainli brighten the japanes economi s futur by the time the 1994 budget is formul econom measur will becom fix and i certainli hope the measur will meet the peopl s expect report in connect with the previou question on the peopl s greatest concern could you tell me the size of the incom tax reduct and it revenu resourc hosokawa i cannot give an answer to that at thi point the govern and the rule parti are discuss the matter now i think a conclus will shape up by the middl of januari report you have just state that the govern will take action to secur employ of worker over 65 year old as a mid to long term task howev the unemploy rate is gradual pick up nationwid and the number of jobless is increas in the busi sector in thi regard how much do you estim the nation s unemploy and econom growth rate in 1994 will be hosokawa the govern is schedul to announc it econom forecast in mid januari in definit figur concern employ secur measur i have repeatedli said in diet interpel that the govern is tri it best to draw up measur for secur employ at the labor ministri s initi in fact employ condit are becom seriou in the nation and i am realli concern about the present circumst as i note in my new year s statement and a previou news confer the govern intend to deal with employ relat issu with everi possibl measur i am serv as the chairman of the govern s employ polici headquart to fulli engag in the task report mr prime minist my question is again about the govern s tax reduct plan chairman hiroshi kato of the advisori tax system research council met with you yesterday and insist that the govern should promis a futur increas of the consumpt tax if the incom tax is implement thi fiscal year in other word he said a bill for incom tax cut should includ a pledg on a futur increas of the consumpt tax rate while you take a stanc to attach import to tax panel polici are you realli go to enact the incom tax cut and the consumpt tax hike at the same time hosokawa as a matter of cours we have to attach much import to the tax panel s opinion but the govern s attitud toward the panel s advisori report is also under debat at the consult committe organ by the coalit parti the committe will determin the coalit s tax reform polici hope in consider of the tax panel s advisori report report in the statement s conclus you said the busi climat will improv thi year after the stock adjust phase when we assess if the stock adjust phase is well under way we must pay attent to the fact that financi institut bad loan are one of the main reason for the prolong recess thi is a signific differ from the preced recess so some peopl are question if the govern ha the proper remedi for the stagnant economi they say the govern must have drastic and unusu remedi such as larg scale public invest and incom tax cut with the issuanc of deficit cover bond what is your attitud toward such an opinion hosokawa i have repeatedli note that we must be veri care of thoughtless depend on deficit cover bond on the other hand the govern is serious seek measur to encourag transact of real estat while we have no definit plan right now we are tri veri hard to seiz some good idea report again on the consumpt tax mr prime minist it seem you intend to wait for the coalit parti discuss to end but you will have to make your own decis sooner or later do you have the resolv to demonstr your leadership to make a futur orient decis on tax revenu hosokawa i am veri sorri but i cannot answer that question at thi point take into account a conclus drawn by the coalit parti i would like to make a proper decis for the futur report to cope with the age societi you have clarifi your stanc to ask heavier burden of the public to improv servic for the age it is necessari to reinforc manpow to work on thi field on the other hand the govern is expect to have more manpow through deregul polici do you intend to minim the public s burden by util the surplu manpow to overcom bureaucrat section hosokawa that is an interest idea but i have no definit plan yet report your statement includ guidelin on variou issu howev it may be difficult to carri them out under bureaucrat section while the statement advoc administr reform how will you draw up definit measur hosokawa as a matter of cours individu ministri and agenc are primarili in charg and outlin of reform plan are introduc to the coalit parti leader they will thoroughli discuss administr reform and it detail will be materi in the 1994 budget and other govern polici of cours propos in my statement are base on ministri polici such as econom program the five year plan for improv social infrastructur and the nation develop plan also the hiraiwa commiss and the tax panel gave me lot of suggest my statement wa made in accord with all of these i am just explain such propos in my own word they may look more drastic though i will request the ministri draw up tangibl measur for carri out administr reform base on my principl report pleas let me ask again on thi point sinc the financ ministri and the sdpj are not in accord on the treatment of the consumpt tax your leadership as prime minist is like to be strongli expect on thi issu could you explain your resolv again hosokawa needless to say i have to make final decis regardless of whether it is a matter of rice or someth els anyhow it is an import issu we have to find a desir balanc between receiv benefit and share burden anyhow as i have said earlier our societi is age and it is unavoid that the work peopl s burden will grow heavier under such a circumst some peopl may say that they do not want to shoulder the burden other may say that they do not want to see a further declin in social secur servic what kind of decis are the peopl go to support are they go to say that it is import not to lower the standard of the social secur servic even at the cost of bear some burden are they go to say that they will accept lower the standard of incom secur shotoku hosho becaus they do not want to shoulder the burden or are they go to accept a signific increas in the burden on peopl in the prime of their work live or the loss of thi vital power of societi anyhow we have to make our decis on the choic we have of cours it is veri difficult to have everybodi s consensu howev the rule parti are studi these matter to make their decis which will be accept by as mani peopl as possibl they will be abl to show the peopl sever choic after go through these process i will have to make my final decis report let me ask you a question regard a final decis you have just mention you said earlier that the rule parti which are current studi the issu will make their decis around mid januari are you go to make your final decis befor the end of januari even if they fail to reach an agreement by mid januari hosokawa they have to make a decis i want them to do their best to come up with some kind of decis by all mean report i am go to ask you about the polit reform bill discuss in the hous of councillor are virtual at a standstil how are you go to display your leadership to find a way out of thi situat hosokawa frankli speak i would like them to start discuss immedi anyway more than 40 day have pass sinc the bill were sent to the hous of councillor well we had to deal with the supplementari budget propos and other thing such as the uruguay round dure thi time accordingli discuss at the hous of repres did not go smoothli i understand thi veri well howev we still have a consider number of day left for discuss after new year s day therefor i do want to pass the polit reform bill dure the current diet session in the past five year we have vainli tri to approv polit reform bill i will do my best to promot diet deliber on the bill a fundament way is to have detail discuss in the diet on the bill in the presenc of both rule and opposit parti if an agreement can be reach at diet discuss the govern of cours is readi to respect it report are you not plan to make a compromis by make major chang to the bill hosokawa well the answer to your question may be a repetit of what i have said earlier howev i am of the opinion that the fundament approach is to have discuss between the rule and opposit parti to reach an agreement report regard the polit reform bill it seem that some peopl are again say that an elect system reform should be treat apart from the prevent of polit corrupt what is your opinion on thi hosokawa as i repeatedli said dure the diet meet these issu are like front and rear wheel of a car we have to chang the current medium size constitu system in which member of the same parti fight with each other dure elect i do not think the bill on prevent polit corrupt alon will improv polit i think simultan approv of the four bill is necessari by all mean to realiz polit reform report some member of the rule parti are also talk about the possibl of dissolv the lower hous what do you think of dissolv the lower hous amid the depress hosokawa i have no such plan report let me go back to the econom issu word indistinct do you think that rule parti will hold joint meet in januari to talk about short and medium term comprehens matter not onli emerg econom measur while keep an eye on the 21st centuri in particular hosokawa we have to form a draft budget for the next fiscal year while keep an eye on long term matter report you said earlier that you were not think about dissolv the lower hous in a recent news confer you said that you were prepar for the worst what are you go to do if the reform bill are not approv hosokawa i cannot disclos what i am plan to do there are mani thing that i am think about report you have cancel your plan trip to europ japan u s summit talk will be held in februari can you give us an outlin of your diplomat schedul for thi year hosokawa japan u s summit talk will be held in februari deal with the japan u s comprehens econom consult is a veri difficult task we are now do our best to deal with the negoti which are veri difficult as a major topic the result of the consult will probabl be confirm at the upcom japan u s summit talk other than that i have no urgent diplomat plan for the time be of cours summit of the group of seven develop countri will be held in juli howev i have no concret diplomat plan for the period between now and juli report reportedli you were invit to visit china are you plan to visit china hosokawa i have receiv an invit from china and from some european countri but i have not decid yet on a concret schedul report i will ask you question about a total differ matter it is regard 100 million yen you borrow from the sagawa group the opposit parti are determin to ask you question on thi matter at the diet meet right after new year s day do you think that the document which you submit earlier to both lower and upper hous is enough to explain the situat also are you not plan to correct what wa written in the document hosokawa i am earnestli tri to see if i can submit someth addit at thi moment i cannot say for sure whether or not i will be abl to submit anyth els howev i believ that the document i submit earlier dispel the doubt that i did not pay back the money howev i heard some peopl are still suspici therefor i am tri to see if i can submit addit document report in addit to a doubt regard whether or not you have paid back the money some peopl suspect that the money wa use toward expens for your gubernatori elect they suspect that the money wa not use in the way you have explain can you comment on thi hosokawa as i repeatedli explain at the diet i did not borrow the money to use for polit purpos report i would like to ask you again a question regard the consumpt tax it sound to me as if you were say at the begin of your speech that you had no choic but to increas the consumpt tax rate i think what you said wa not veri clear to the peopl either you have been say that you had entrust the rule parti with studi the consumpt tax issu do you not think that the peopl would have a clear understand if you explain to them that the govern ha no choic but to increas the consumpt tax sooner or later hosokawa i understand what you mean but it will be like put the cart befor the hors if i explain my idea and show a certain direct befor the rule parti come up with their propos in their meet the rule parti are studi variou choic the peopl can make i am of the opinion that i should make my final decis after the rule parti come up with their propos report concern an incom tax cut you repeatedli said sinc last autumn that you want to wait for discuss on the issu and a report to be work out by the tax reform council but all of a sudden in decemb you express a plan to set up the rule parti econom affair consult council to ask the council to discuss the incom tax cut issu in thi connect howev mana kubota director gener of the econom plan agenc said in a news confer that a polit decis should be made on thi issu there is a voic among the peopl that you lack leadership and that the govern ha miss the time of carri out the incom tax cut how do you answer thi view hosokawa well i fulli understand that the peopl greatli expect the govern to carri out the incom tax cut but as i have repeatedli mention earlier if we carri out the incom tax cut without secur the revenu sourc the next gener will have to pay for it and i do not think thi is desir for that reason my view is that we need to serious studi thi issu i know that the situat will be more seriou if we miss the opportun with thi in mind i think it is necessari to promot discuss on thi issu while seek the rule parti understand report mr prime minist you have constantli said that the excess issuanc of deficit cover bond is undesir it is probabl ideal for the govern to includ both the tax cut and tax hike in the govern s draft bill on tax reform but assum that the govern fail to includ the tax cut and hike in it bill but instead reach an agreement with the rule coalit to issu short term bond to make up for a loss caus by the tax cut do you think the issuanc of deficit cover bond under the agreement among the rule parti is still undesir hosokawa i am ask the rule coalit to strain their wit to studi thi issu includ the possibl issuanc of short term deficit cover bond and i also hope that they will come up with some idea report i think you probabl have difficulti in adjust polici with the rule parti and ministri or agenc concern but i think that not onli the report here but also the peopl feel that your polit stanc is chang now from your origin posit wherein you said that you would show your polici to the peopl in a straightforward manner i think thi is whi the peopl think you lack leadership in solv issu includ the issu of cut tax and rais the consumpt tax how do you consid your current posit hosokawa i know what you are say but i am requir to manag the govern in the unpreced polit situat wherein the eight parti form a coalit on the rice issu i gave my utmost to the veri limit to obtain consensu from member of the rule parti to prevent japan from be isol from the intern commun from my offic i repeatedli call gatt director gener sutherland and ask him to wait for anoth one or two hour while wait for an agreement among the rule parti so eventu as you know i made a decis on the partial open of the rice market if i should make ani decis without discuss among the rule parti the coalit govern compos of the eight parti would collaps i do not think it is desir to break the coalit govern i fulli understand that the peopl are eager to see my earli decisionmak in the past the cabinet wa allow to solv issu one by one howev mani issu are simultan fall upon the current coalit govern i think that even when it wa the one parti rule by the liber democrat parti there must have been sharp debat within the parti on such difficult issu but now exchang of sharp debat within the govern is inevit becaus the coalit govern is form by eight parti given such a situat what i can do is to promot discuss among the rule parti to reflect the peopl s expect in the govern s polici as much as possibl and then make a decis while seek possibl compromis among the rule parti so thi is what i want the peopl to understand report there is the view that the hosokawa govern is attach import onli to domest issu and ignor it relat with the unit state what do you think of thi hosokawa as i said earlier japan and the unit state are face veri difficult econom issu howev i think that through the previou two meet the presid and i have further deepen our understand that the basic relat between japan and the unit state have been play a great role in the world and the intern commun the issu concern the japan u s econom framework talk need to be immedi solv for exampl prioriti is given to such microeconom issu as auto and auto part govern procur insur and way to beef up the u s compani competit power the japanes govern is face too mani difficult issu but asid from these issu the govern is make effort to provid good result regard the import issu between japan and the unit state by the time a summit is held in februari although the issu may not be solv perfectli i think we have to come to some conclus which both japan and the unit state can accept presid clinton and i also have fulli confirm it is signific and import to deepen firm bilater relat in the intern commun and accomplish global cooper in solv such issu as environment protect and measur to cope with the grow world popul and aid other than the immedi microeconom issu and i understand that our view remain unchang dean of the press corp time ha come now to close the prime minist s new year news confer thank you veri much
