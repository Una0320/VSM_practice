vitaliy ivanovich i must admit that i had want to begin our convers with the recent cholera outbreak in kazakhstan but it seem that we need not go so far for exampl yefremenko unfortun that s true the epidem situat is extrem unstabl today in the south of russia and especi in the northern caucasian region a littl over 2 year ago cholera visit stavropol and quit recent krasnodar rostov makhachkala we had to fight anthrax in karachayevo cherkesia and now in kabardino balkaria the incid of leptospirosi ha increas in the kuban region there is a veri complex situat regard brucellosi and tularemia highli danger diseas though sometim they aren t perceiv to be so by the layman final six of russia s natur plagu foci are locat in the northern caucasu take a look at the map they re all mark in the elbru vicin in particular over there can you see bykov ye i see and honestli i feel extrem uneasi isn t it like we re live on a volcano yefremenko when epidemiolog observ and reconnaiss are constantli maintain when monitor is organ when diseas carri rodent are destroy and prevent work is carri out within the popul the danger of a plagu outbreak is rel low in ani case god ha been kind to us for over 40 year but we shouldn t of cours becom complac it is the object of our institut and of the state sanitari epidemiolog servic as well to take the most decis step in respons to the slightest suspicion recent for exampl specialist had to make an urgent trip to a certain eastern rayon of stavropol kray where the bodi of a man wa discov in the stepp on territori that is epizoot in relat to plagu as it turn out the person had been wander and simpli froze but thi doesn t mean that the trip and the inspect were unnecessari bykov but thi is improb difficult monitor the situat on a territori commensur with the territori of certain european state yefremenko difficult it may be but our scientif research institut which is one of five russian region institut of thi profil exist precis for the purpos of ensur epidem safeti that s first and second you mustn t think that all of the work is done from here out of stavropol plagu station are oper in novorossiysk nalchik and makhachkala there is a branch network of plagu depart and special detach are work local bykov by the way vitaliy ivanovich whi are all of these subdivis includ the head institut call plagu institut don t you deal with other danger diseas as well yefremenko thi is probabl done out of tradit in the past plagu wa the most menac danger and in addit our institut develop out of a plagu station establish back in 1933 today we are in fact deal with cholera anthrax and brucellosi moreov life is forc us to join the fight against viral diseas such as influenza hepat and other it wa for thi purpos that the institut organ a virolog laboratori we provid what help we can to aid prevent center as well bykov in other word you are widen the front of the struggl against diseas so to speak but not onli are they not intend to retreat on the contrari they are gather strength what s it worth talk about influenza if even newspap report about cholera or anthrax have ceas to be sensat yefremenko that s all true but let s think about whi thi is happen on one hand there are an enorm number of peopl today who are not get complet balanc nutrit while some simpli don t get enough to eat add to thi the present commonli known woe of our public health and the best possibl condit for growth of diseas becom obviou but there is anoth side as well i am refer to the atmospher of anarchi all permiss and lack of control reign in the countri sharpli intensifi the risk bykov can you pleas give an exampl yefremenko i can give you as mani as you want the danger of contract anthrax ha alway exist it agent can surviv for a veri long time in what is known as it spore form and all you need is to have a rainstorm or a mud flow expos a livestock burial site befor a suffici depend barrier wa maintain first by vaccin farm anim and second by inspect meat brought in for sale and process but now not onli privat owner but commerci farmer are econom on immun and meat could be sold right on the street without have undergon laboratori inspect thi wa approxim the scenario of the recent infect of a coupl of dozen peopl by anthrax in karachayevo cherkesia s adyg khablskiy rayon bykov so what about cholera as far as i know it is brought to us from far away import so to speak yefremenko ye chiefli from asian countri pakistan syria india but even here we can observ disregard for elementari requir shortcut and other effort at econom go abroad our homemad businessmen whose number are now imposs to count depriv themselv of normal life food and drink in their race for profit just one swallow of infect water is all it take to bring cholera back to the homeland by the way despit their larg number muslim pilgrim for whom normal live condit are creat in saudi arabia have never brought us ani troubl bykov i heard a tragicom stori in your institut about two businessmen who had pick up cholera vibrio in foreign land escap from the hospit in krasnodar after chang their ident they didn t feel like lie around and so they left to make more money do peopl realli not understand that we are talk about a seriou threat to both health and life itself yefremenko some don t understand other follow the old russian it ll never happen to me philosophi but there are also those who are forc to risk their health and life due to circumst beyond their control i am refer to refuge who have flood our region poor depriv of all basic necess and at the same time activ move from place to place they are a sourc of special danger i m not talk just about the diseas name abov in thi case can we exclud for exampl outbreak of typhu if pediculosi ha becom a common thing unfortun no bykov are you say that what we have here is a risk group in the flesh and what about the rel better off strata and categori of the popul who among them suffer more those live in the citi or in the countrysid or can you put the question thi way yefremenko in gener diseas doesn t ask you where you come from all the more so if you consid the densiti of the migrat flow the high mobil of the entir popul and the transpar of the border but if we consid the person or domest level then a herder work within a natur plagu focu risk more than an urban dweller though less than a careless poorli equip tourist countri dweller probabl also have a greater risk of anthrax infect becaus they work with farm anim howev infect meat could be sold in the citi as well perhap the onli uncontest rural diseas is brucellosi rural inhabit should protect themselv from it especi care and not treat it as someth harmless a frighten diseas bykov doe your warn mean that save the drown is a task primarili of the drown themselv yefremenko there s noth wrong with be extra cautiou or with listen to the advic of specialist though of cours they may also label immun as a bad thing but then there s no reason to be amaz that the number of case of let us say diphtheria is grow howev despit all of thi prevent of danger diseas effici detect of sourc and foci treatment of patient and prevent of epidem are natur nation task and it is no accid that we are now develop a region program against especi danger infect encompass all of the south of russia we are also rais the question of organiz unifi the plagu servic with the sanitari epidemiolog servic but we like everyon els have mani problem bykov money yefremenko not just that although financ is one of the most pain issu consid what seem like a simpl thing an on site visit by our specialist thi ha becom simpli danger to life when it come to chechen ingushetia or northern ossetia nonetheless believ me we aren t sit idl the institut doe have a rather consider potenti bykov can we talk a littl about someth els our interview ha taken such a moros turn yefremenko well there isn t much to be happi about but as far as the institut is concern it would be hard of cours to describ it work in just a few word you would probabl be interest for exampl that an intern refer center of the world health organ work in the institut it ha an extens data bank on plagu cover asian and a number of european countri there are also three other center a detect center a center for zoonos of the south of russia and a train center that prepar personnel for the ci our collect of flea plagu vector is second in import in the world the first be in england without go into the name of all of the divis and laboratori let me note that research is be conduct at a respect level in particular we are work on pharmaceut of a new gener that surmount the cellular barrier we have start product of diagnost materi base on magnosorb make it possibl to detect an infect sourc effici and precis in short no matter how danger diseas might be we are in no way defenseless against them bykov well let s end on thi note wish success to the peopl whose work is discuss in the paper far more rare than the outbreak of the frighten diseas they fight and health to all in our unfortun danger time
