text the latest anniversari of the declar of human right pass almost unnot in russia by an ironi of fate it coincid with the apoge of the elect campaign perhap it wa for thi reason that it wa notic onli by a small circl of profession polit scientist sociologist and employe of specif grassroot and civil right organ yet human right and liberti are it would seem that sole purpos and overrid mission for the sake of which mani of us in april 1985 or in august 1991 and subsequ also perhap were prepar to renounc everyth contain in the notori period of stagnat but the perestroyka era ha end smoothli pass into the era of radic reform a great recast of power properti and life s foundat and the euphoria of the triumph in connect with the emancip from the seven decad of slaveri of the nation spirit ha evapor like smoke leav the peopl in it wake mere the ash of the char ruin and all that wa in ani way valuabl which had been accumul by the gener ha vanish there ha also somehow impercept been a divis of the monolith of fellow thinker of perestroyka onc weld togeth by an inspir idea into fighter for the peopl s interest and the peopl themselv into the possessor of right and the bearer of oblig which have for some reason or other becom for a larg part of the populac even more oner and thi can be trace graphic against the background of the struggl for human right in the strike and prestrik action of the worker of mani sector of the economi those work in health care and educ and geolog and commun agrarian specialist and mechan engin and coal miner have been or are now in thi posit more than you can count there is no doubt that our acquisit of the right to express a protest is a good thing but it would be even better did we not have to avail ourselv of it particularli so often for it is well known that in the period of the shock reform some sector have been almost perman in a strike or prestrik condit thi is i believ far from the best achiev of democraci and not the right of the work peopl for the sake of which it wa worth accomplish perestroyka in it variou substanc it is time evid to stop search for the reason for so unequivoc an attitud of the bulk of societi toward the socioeconom process occur in the countri these reason have long been obviou to all they are the catastroph declin in the live standard the menac growth of unemploy the narrow of peopl s access to sociocultur benefit and servic the loss of their hard earn save and the repuls of the major of citizen from privat and so forth how is thi actual situat of the work peopl combin with the manifold increas in the number of right and liberti of the citizen record in the new constitut while not a legal expert or polit scientist i ventur to maintain that the right and the number thereof even and in just a cursori studi of the new constitut i discov more than three dozen right and liberti in themselv do noth for a singl one of the possessor of these right if they are total unsupport guarante by no one and subject to no precis control in other word it is not the right themselv but the guarante of right that are need and everyon should know who the expon of the specif guarante is after all what is the valu of the right to hous i would recal that in the constitut that previous wa in effect the state guarante all citizen a roof over their head with the appal shortag of hous and the uncontrol format of the hous market what use is the right to educ with the beggarli grant of the student which is onli enough for one meal a week and of what sort of right to recreat and health can we speak when the cost of a pass to a sanatorium is 10 15 time the averag monthli wage in the nation economi but in addit of what sort of freedom of movement can we speak if the cost of one s journey to a suburban dacha damag the famili budget as much as a trip to the riga shore onc did of what sort of right to social secur can we speak when the averag pension is one third below the physiolog subsist minimum and the major of retire may with their pension buy onli a loaf of bread and a liter of milk a day and thi is not count the charg for hous for other elementari servic for the use of mass transit i would question also freedom of thought and creativ sinc visit an art galleri or museum go to the movi or the theater and buy book are now afford onli to the spoil children of the liber economi i am afraid even to mention the right to properti and inherit inasmuch as there immedi aris here question concern the r70 trillion in current comput of hard earn save confisc by the reform the manifestli formal particip of the peopl in privat you could not count all the right not back by the correspond guarante but i would like to recal one further right of our to digniti truli it is thi which both soviet and even more russian man have alway lack but with what doe our new statehood back thi right now with the fact that the holder of hard earn russian rubl the quantiti of which for the workhors is strictli determin by a singl wage rate qualif guid feel themselv to be at everi step in their own countri third class citizen with the fact that million of onc perfectli respect peopl on the book of enterpris now paralyz by the monetarist idea have taken in just a coupl of penni have been forc to run to the street market to sell and exchang whatev come to hand i am afraid that real back for all the abov mention and a dozen unment right and liberti will requir and veri soon of the state the most specif and precis action the time of abstract deliber by legal scholar parti chief and supernumerari prattler ha pass all the mechan of econom reform and social reform which is manifestli in need of reform should be gear to the realiz of the right and liberti of the citizen and as long as the econom and social ingredi of the reform contradict the truth inscrib in intern and our constitut tablet all the innumer right and liberti of russian will be paper right onli all the more will the special freedom depart the human right committe form in the offic of the presid of the russian feder fail to cope with these task grant all my respect for the person composit of the said committe i confess that i veri much doubt whether it will be abl to establish a balanc between the quantiti of right and liberti and the real assur of a normal life for the citizen of russia there remain hope of the feder assembl but it ha bare been elect ha not yet even been conven and struggl ha alreadi begun not for our the elector s right unfortun
