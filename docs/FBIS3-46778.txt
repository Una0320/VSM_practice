languag f p 105 english f articl type bfn f p 106 excerpt from the paper nuclear disarma and f nonprolifer in northeast asia by dr jan yong sup aid to the defens ministri text north korean have maintain that their nuclear program is sole for peac purpos and went a step further alleg that the peac natur of their nuclear program ha been prove sinc the first iaea intern atom energi agenc for ad hoc inspect accord to the north korean govern s explan to the iaea they develop spent fuel reprocess plant for the later use of fast breeder reactor or mix oxid fuel ad howev north korea s technolog capabl doe not match with such advanc technolog thi can be interpret as a groundless excus howev the experiment 5mwe reactor at yongbyon is a graphit moder natur uranium fuel and ga cool reactor which is more appropri for gener spent fuel as quickli as possibl to produc weapon grade plutonium rather than for gener electr north korean are reluct to sign the chemic weapon convent cwc becaus it claus pertain to inspect may spill over to the nuclear issu if they accept the cwc there will be no ground to shrink from ani kind of inspect decis to go nuclear seem to have been made in the earli 1960 the push for the program becam more compel in the late 1980 for the follow reason north korea s concern about rise cost when tri to match more advanc south korean convent weapon capabl it concern about cutback in soviet arm suppli and the kremlin s distanc from the north to becom closer to the south china s failur to provid ani real substitut and lastli the concern reinforc by the technolog superior u s led multi nation forc defeat the soviet arm iraqi in the gulf war more seriou is north korea s intent to wage anoth war with nuclear weapon in an era of auster for the north korean regim which is doom to collaps if the worst case scenario unfold to initi a surpris attack on the south and occupi some territori and negoti a surpris attack on the south and occupi some territori and negoti for the termin of war or to deni u s reinforc by threaten to use nuclear weapon as we know from north korea s behavior toward the iaea inspect it nuclear polici is no more than withhold inform hinder cover up and fabric fact the north korean have alleg they have extract a tini amount gram unit of plutonium in 1990 howev they withheld the inform as to what they have done with the plutonium and what they have done with the reprocess capabl sinc then an analysi of the sampl taken from the small amount of plutonium indic larg discrep with the time and the number of batch process h5 actual amount h5 the discrep larg have to do with the actual amount of plutonium they have extract estim rang between 8 kg and 24 kg north korea s offici respons to the outsid world about it nuclear weapon program is alway the same we have no intent nor capabl to manufactur nuclear weapon if north korea push the nuclear program the consequ will be signific not be limit to the korean peninsula the fear that the north may use nuclear weapon in war provid seoul with a strong incent to get nuclear weapon japan will hardli toler such a situat either have advanc nuclear technolog and a seriou concern about north korea s deep strike deliveri capabl there may be no reason for japan to sit idl though the iaea ha conduct six ad hoc inspect on north korean nuclear site it could not find out the total of the north korean nuclear program as is known the iaea inspect regim ha inher limit the iaea inspect are limit to the site declar by a member state when the state itself refrain from declar and identifi it secret activ there is no effect way to inspect the undeclar site as of now though the iaea board of governor alreadi ha reaffirm the iaea s right to request inspect to identifi undeclar nuclear materi in case there are reason to believ such materi exist and explan have not clarifi the matter north korea is becom the first test case for special inspect befor such special inspect becom institution there exist no effect way to prevent clandestin effort under there present iaea inspect regim to develop nuclear weapon despit the iaea safeguard inspect keep these limit in mind and attempt to resolv major discrep between north korea s declar and the iaea s find the iaea board of governor meet issu a resolut that call on the north to fulli cooper with the iaea to enabl the iaea to conduct special inspect on the two suspect site within one month after the adopt of the resolut if north korea doe not respond posit thi case may be brought to the u n secur council after the deliber process by the iaea board of governor if the iaea and south korea do not succeed in prevent the north korean nuclear program within a short period of time then vocal sentiment insid south korean may rise to reconsid the polici of not develop nuclear reprocess and uranium enrich capabl even more seriou is the possibl of go nuclear north korea s nuclear facil capac year of start up place research reactor 8 mwt june
