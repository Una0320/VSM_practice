constitu govern then excerpt passag omit statera let us admit it mr martinazzoli your imag is not a veri smooth one and your languag is not suffici basic martinazzoli i am well acquaint with my face and i have no problem with it even though it is not the hollywood type i certainli do noth to make it smoother becaus i refus to show off and i am irrit by stereotyp smile and unnatur in polit i will not disguis myself becaus i am convinc that at least a littl truth is fundament in polit statera but to go from that to the funer martinazzoli i know i am even said to be abl to cast the evil eye and to lower audienc rate but funari televis present for one doe not think so in ani case my face make me the real leader of the neo centrist by virtu of all my skin blemish statera that is a good one martinazzoli as for my languag the ultim would be not to speak at all sinc televis encourag not think but watch but sinc i do not expect an oscar nomin i reject thi mystif polit need word not look teeth and banal statera so will the centrist not make much use of televis martinazzoli look thi is not just an anti conformist option it is also a financi necess the resourc avail to the right and the left are infinit greater than our we will spend some 3 4 billion lire and forza italia leader silvio berlusconi s right 10 15 time more statera you mean 40 billion martinazzoli more more an entrepreneur can throw hi money around howev he pleas i admit that i do not know the anthropolog profil of the berlusconi man but i must assum that he is not onli a yuppi but must also be a support and in some instanc also a volunt otherwis berlusconi would go broke how much must those strang 11 000 club cost him be that as it may do not make me say that i want to disinv televis and it polit product it is not true i am simpli well awar of what popper said of the danger of the manipul of consensu the problem of freedom connect with the domin of the mass media we need new ethic for which even the foundat are lack statera do you mean self regul for televis martinazzoli self regul make me laugh for the first time giuliano ferrara is right when he ridicul it moreov i support fede who broadcast berlusconi s first remark true it took consider faith fede pardon the pun to sit there and watch that program but i did so and found it interest though i perceiv some grim warn in it statera of what martinazzoli though of cours berlusconi is not the devil incarn unfortun the idea of a charismat public base and plastic democraci is take hold amid thi desert but polit extend beyond mere the home health and certain sacrosanct necess it is the complex relationship among all these thing which must not be oversimplifi in order not to creat fals hope you cannot make hand of promis use argument that do no hang togeth statera you yourself said that the sublim of televis is to remain silent simpli to be seen martinazzoli ye but i am still convinc that the peopl are not simpli an audienc and that life is not entir confin to televis inde life conflict with it televis imag face powder is not everyth i hope that argument still count for someth some american friend agre with me in thi when they heard that in our constitu some 35 000 vote are need in order to be elect they told me in that case you can meet with the voter individu and promis someth to each one we are not relinquish direct contact with the peopl and are thu exorc invis which is a curs in polit it is like bet on a lame hors a moder visibl not a vulgar spectacular one kafka said that if ulyss had not put wax in hi ear he would have die not from hear from siren song but from the silenc statera do you refus to answer report question becaus you fear banal martinazzoli at one time we had gorresio but now authorit opinion maker stay in their offic and write about thing they know noth about and journalist have been taught onli to report wittic i do not like to talk in wittic i hate appear to be someth that i am not i am a lawyer from brescia precis as your fellow journalist from cuneo said dismiss but what more than wittic can be produc by a polit that is now conduct with the abacu statera who now conduct polit with the abacu martinazzoli when i visit berlusconi around christma i told him look if you use the arithmet logic of the abacu even the tradit mistrust of the italian social movement msi will ceas to exist i tri to explain to him that we have been part of italian histori sinc 1919 we saw mussolini grow up and saw mani popular parti member go with him but sturzo and other went into exil instead an exil which de gasperi then legitim you need to take the long view i told him he repli still use the abacu if it is he who is that the italian want then let them have him but they must know that the exil of polit will not benefit anyon i am talk not about threat of dictatorship but about the disappear of the veri substanc of democraci the mere fact of appeal to a savior who make all kind of promis mean that democraci is lose it veri mean we are in danger of becom what arbasino call a countri without statera without what martinazzoli without histori without ani authorit voic peopl talk about a countri reduc to rubbl but that is nonsens recount by peopl with bad memori it is nonsens to say that everyth that exist befor the second republ should be reject thi display a shortcom on the part of itali s intellectu it is not clear whether they are more quick chang artist or conformist thi is a clumsili revolutionari period which some peopl have exploit statera who martinazzoli what do you mean who berlusconi who if he deserv ani credit it is for have arriv at the right moment when the whole scene wa in disarray to put forward a chang with no sens of direct statera upstag pact for itali leader segni martinazzoli ye with a kind of cheap trick after the troubl over the list segni must at least have realiz that referendum movement are not polit and that you realli cannot conduct polit without some kind of organ in modern democraci parti are not redund as some maintain we need to start draw a distinct between corrupt and the valu of parti that have been cure of them that is unless we want the lead role to be perform by televis station and mass media conglomer instead of polit itself statera pardon me mr martinazzoli but do you not have the impress that while you are compet for seat in parliament other center of power are defin a new order for itali martinazzoli i certainli do have that impress sever major vest interest think that they can do without the mediat of polit the eclips of polit also embodi a contest between econom potent telecommun televis the bank and so forth we risk becom subject rather than agent or watch the cake be slice up among variou busi directli by their lead figur one of whom moreov is also person involv in polit statera so is thi invis center becom increasingli margin martinazzoli keep in mind that we have two year of honor conduct behind us and i would like that to be acknowledg we have support the polici of prime minist amato and ciampi and inde we have help ciampi more than anyon els and i have had enough statera of what of ciampi martinazzoli no i realli have had enough of hear democrat parti of the left secretari achil occhetto portray himself as a quintino sella prefascist financ minist he is not it is we who have support thi govern even though we recogn it polit limit statera but do you think that thi can be consid a merit by the berlusconi man by voter poison by rather stupid clich martinazzoli mani respect thing in thi countri were the outcom of minor the risorgimento the resist statera so you would not mind be in a minor martinazzoli i do not like be in a minor at all i have no vocat to be a martyr but i am sure that polit is not like a restaur where the custom is alway right you engag in polit for the sake of you own person idea and i am rather stubborn about mine statera veri well but berlusconi enjoy a virtual monopoli of support occhetto ha hi own tough kernel martinazzoli forget about the opinion poll let us talk about seriou matter mayb one of the three bloc will win if berlusconi s win on the basi of the abacu then it will govern otherwis i see a gloomi futur for that front can you not see that bossi is muzzl and that hi lead role ha been undermin if they win perhap they will succeed in stay togeth otherwis statera what if occhetto win martinazzoli more or less the same appli occhetto quintino sella critic me from london he who is alli with the man who want to tax govern stock how is it possibl either on the right or on the left to accept allianc that exist sole for technic reason statera veri well mr martinazzoli the centrist too might win but let us consid the most like hypothesi that none of the three align win martinazzoli i do not believ that if someon is sick he can be oper on everi six month so if that doe happen i would tri to salvag thi legislatur statera how martinazzoli sinc we do not know how the new parliament will behav and we do not know how the seat will be distribut i have in mind not a second ciampi govern but a constitu govern which will tackl the mass of constitut problem statera do you mean that you are resist the rule of altern to the bitter end martinazzoli not at all we want altern but not fictiti altern or wors someth that is not altern but the split up of the countri statera what exactli would thi constitu govern have to do martinazzoli complet an elector reform that is anyth but complet establish a forum for the debat on the specter of feder provid a guarante that constitut amend will not entail sudden violent wrench or excess but will take place possibl by mean of a number of referendum not onli on abrog but also to indic prefer statera a new form of association martinazzoli no i repeat whoever win will govern and i also repeat that we will not merg with the left as mani suspect but if nobodi win the patient must not be kill there must be a constitu forum that will take the place of the assembl elect directli by the peopl which i myself cossiga and miglio had in mind and thi forum could be precis a constitu govern statera what would it purpos be martinazzoli there are sever differ within the pact i am not in favor of the direct elect of the prime minist which is what segni want i have in mind rather a german style system with a chancellor statera what will your own role be martinazzoli i would like to think that i have help to prevent a disintegr and on that basi to take my leav statera thu regain true invis martinazzoli look we may be somewhat invis but we do have a core of popular support that those peopl with all that face powder and make up can onli dream of statera are you pledg that there will be no televis appear between now and 27 march martinazzoli sinc nobodi is give us ani free half hour be that as it may you can be sure that you will not be see me on il rosso e il nero the red and the black where opium and variou other drug are consum ideolog one of cours
