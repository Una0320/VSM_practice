violant until now we have had two type of attack one kind is extermin the elimin of a singl enemi like the judg gaetano costa and rocco chinnici the other kind is one of dialogu the bomb in the spring and summer protest the harsh prison condit result from the modif made in juli 1992 to articl 41bi of the prison regul we have not yet had strike aim at obstruct which have the same function as the gunfir of a patrol in protect behind the front line in earn time in the futur thi is the kind we will have to deal with milella then whi are they target individu like you like prosecutor giancarlo caselli and the head of dia gianni de gennaro violant the fact that there are so mani object prove my theori the murder of giovanni falcon and paolo borsellino just two month apart alreadi signal the begin of thi strategi it is project of extermin target all the strong point milella will the state have the strength to stand up to it violant mani massacr have alreadi been avoid mani peopl are aliv thank to measur of prevent make an attack more difficult is alreadi a step ahead as is arrest the suspect perpetr milella after the bomb of rome florenc and milan there wa talk of mafia terror of an allianc between the mafia mason extremist on the right and govern secret agent who have turn traitor is thi still a valid theori violant the mafia doe not act alon the crimin element from sicili campania and calabria have alway had tie with the extremist on the right it happen in the past with the massacr of train 904 today we have a former member of the new order movement and of the mafia pietro rampulla arrest for the capaci ambush rosario cattafi from messina is involv in the traffic of arm there is domenico papalia a ndrangheta boss who thank to a uniqu appeal wa abl to have hi murder trial overturn papalia wa the first name mention by antonino gioe the mafioso who kill himself in prison milella that allianc wa not just a theoret assumpt violant there exist a system of subvers forc each with it own histori and it own goal which sometim happen to act togeth just think of the corrupt mason lodg that were key element in the relationship member of the calabrian sicilian mafia etc belong to the same lodg what we are see is the mafia make use of the mason system milella in 1993 polit men who were thought to be untouch like giulio andreotti and antonio gava found themselv under investig what is chang in the relationship between the mafia and polit who are the mafia s new contact violant i do not know if senat andreotti and senat gava are crimin respons veri like the top level of the mafia leadership are now wait to see what will happen if a separatist polit proposit under whatev name or guis were to go ahead it would be an incred opportun for them the mafia which make invest in it relationship with polit is now wait to see it could be that it is wait to alli itself with the futur winner everyon must keep their eye open milella is the mafia also tri to sabatog the investig by influenc the inform violant there could be a strategi of infiltr aim for the most part not at get fals testimoni or stop the trial but at find out where the former mafiosi are be held how they are be guard and what kind of control there is of their famili member so they can kill them it is a question of predomin they have to show that they are stronger than we are as for the inform it is about time a code of profession ethic were pass for the magistr which would establish the regul of the relationship with the state s wit and would determin the schedul and format of the confess milella elect are approach should we be expect demonstr like the bomb in may and juli violant noth can be exclud by anyon the 5 april 1992 elect were preced by the assassin of salvo lima and follow by the massacr of capaci and via d amelio it is like that the strike of obstruct will take place befor parliament is dissolv and after the elect like in 1992 we have the mean to prevent the attack but some cannot be avoid h5 box p 29 h5 h5 embargo h5 we are still lag behind in the hunt for mafia money a meaning comparison would be to say that today on the financi front in the fight against crime we find ourselv in the same situat in which we were at the end of the 1970 s with regard to the crimin front in 1994 luciano violant s principl object and the one on which he will be concentr all hi energi is the battl to stop the dirti money of the cosa nostra and the other crimin organ the presid of the anti mafia commiss explain back then we follow the individu crime commit by the mafia and we did not attack the organ as such the big differ with judg like rocco chinnici gaetano costa giovanni falcon and paolo borsellino wa precis that they went from concentr on the individu respons for the murder to attack the mafia organ in and of itself as a crime in order to then discov the one who were realli guilti of the assassin on the financi front thi chang ha not yet taken place today we are follow the individu case of money launder with posit result statist but we are not yet in a posit to attack the complex organ of money launder the result is that singl channel of money launder are discov while all the rest continu what is violant s propos there should be at least one magistr in each district attorney gener s offic to handl mafia financ we also need to review the law control crimin asset becaus the present one are total inadequ onli 7 percent of the asset seiz are confisc and 11 percent are given back all the rest remain block then we need to period hold joint meet of the special polic forc dia anti mafia investig director ro special oper section sco central oper servic and gico organ crime investig group and the ordinari polic who handl financi matter but without get into our head the idea that we need anoth special organ final intern collabor is indispens becaus a problem like money launder cannot be confront on the level of a singl countri in the futur some form of embargo will have to be consid for countri and bank that welcom mafia fund
