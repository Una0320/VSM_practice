russian soviet socialist republ within the ussr but there are no longer either soviet or social or the union doe b yeltsin remain a compet presid if so will thi be for long all thing pass all thing chang not even two month had elaps befor the presid of russia without a moment s hesit wa abandon the promis to present himself for the verdict of the peopl and agre to earli elect oblig peopl long sinc found a justif of thi ostens surpris step and more than one of cours let us see how convinc they are first it is maintain that the presid ha alreadi put himself up for elect repeatedli and ha on just as mani occas obtain the peopl s trust particularli enthusiast admir speak about a whole five round of elect success negoti by yeltsin to the union parliament to the russian parliament for chairman of the russian parliament for presid and at the 25 april referendum there is much dissembl and misrepresent here elect to the suprem organ of legisl power have noth in common with presidenti elect differ branch of power right author and procedur of elect it is absurd even to speak about the fact that a posit outcom of parliamentari elect endow the highest offic of the state with some particular legal valid never ha it yeltsin s victori at the referendum is indisput as a statesman he obtain the trust of the peopl but thi ha a veri tangenti bear on presidenti elect that is a particular polit action on a competit basi in accord with legisl specifi rule it ha to be recogn that yeltsin ha thu far been elect presid onli onc it remain to be elucid in legal dispassion fashion of what he wa elect presid for me the answer is clear presid of the rsfsr that is not of an independ state not a subject of intern law but of a compon of an integr feder format go by the name of the ussr strictli legal yeltsin acquir that same extent of author which the presid of the republ within the russian feder of kalmykia or tatarstan say have current for the rsfsr wa i repeat mere a union republ within the ussr no more by a wick ironi of polit fate yeltsin by further the demolit of the ussr undermin the legal basi of hi own author in the new independ state accord to the rule of intern law the compet of all the old state institut of the rsfsr the presid the congress the suprem soviet the constitut court have been depreci and becom legal worthless and there have been no new elect as yet and consequ there is in the russian feder no legitim elect presid there is mere an offici invest with the trust of the peopl for the provision discharg of hi oblig and from the legal viewpoint it can in no way be a question of new presidenti elect but of the first elect of a presid of russia as equal of the parliament the local author judg and so forth second it is maintain that yeltsin promis to put himself up for reelect as a concess to the now nonexist suprem soviet there is no one now as it were befor whom the highli signific word are to be kept but thi is at least unconvinc for they were not simpli word but strict legal instrument yeltsin s decre 1400 and other still not rescind it would appear which speak of new presidenti elect within an establish time frame but even were they onli word they were utter repeatedli publicli openli befor the entir peopl in a word a given word and wherea forswear such is bare excus even in everyday life in polit life it is absolut intoler third as our palmerston or talleyrand mr kozyrev elegantli put it russia is in dire need of continu of power and for thi reason allow the presid to complet hi appoint term it sound impress doe it not but the presid s laudatori desir to see the busi through to a conclus in no way cancel out the simpl fact that he doe not possess for thi the requisit legal capac the mandat he obtain from the peopl in 1991 wa appreci differ in term of the extent of right and author and essenti in term of it natur also i also would like a presid endeavor albeit none too success to break with the communist past to remain at the helm of power until 1996 but as distinct from kozyrev i am clearli awar that the presid of a union republ cannot have the full legal valu that would make him a genuin guarantor of the constitut system of a fulli sovereign state have adopt the deplor decis yeltsin made from all viewpoint a mistak have broken hi word he is onc again give the opposit splendid opportun for play the card of the presid s unscrupul and polit hypocrisi the slogan send yeltsin pack gain a second wind under these condit the polit forc and the elector who are the presid s staunch support are put in an awkward posit here unpleas legal repercuss are possibl also the presid now in the absenc of parliament ha becom the most import sourc of law but even after the commenc of the activ of the feder assembl yeltsin will remain with the schedul arrang of polit power a most import constitut figur and hi incomplet legal suffici connect with the limit natur of the presidenti mandat he obtain could in the near futur compel a reconsider of mani decis of the execut as be legal defici we would recal also that yeltsin primordi entrust hi fate as it were to the feder assembl have emphat chang hi own opinion the presid knowingli or otherwis ha humili the futur parliament and the repres author altogeth i do not believ that thi will be that easili forgotten no less deplor is anoth mistak of the presid s also he announc that he had alter hi decis befor the constitut with the idea of a far advanc presidenti republ had been approv at a referendum it transpir that yeltsin wa decid for the peopl as it were the kind of reform of the constitut arrang that russia need in declar that he would remain in offic until 1996 yeltsin wa make it clearli understood to whom to the peopl that there could be in russia onli a presidenti republ for heaven s sake did not the republ in spain and cambodia becom constitut monarchi befor our eye and have we not known in contemporari histori instanc of the convers of presidenti into parliamentari republ and final the last point follow the disband of the ussr multipl void have as of januari 1992 arisen in russia in the legal respect neither the presid nor parliament nor the judici author have possess full and exhaust legal suffici sinc the april referendum the presid undoubtedli becam more legal suffici than parliament but still not to the extent necessari for a democrat state base on the rule of law but circumst could now chang abruptli to hi disadvantag parliament elect for the first time in an independ russia even if in accord with defici rule will inevit be perceiv in the world as an institut of fuller legal valu than a presid who wa sworn in under other constitut and legal condit of an order of magnitud lower both the presid s friend and enemi have known how at the right time to emphas thi impress differ repeatedli of cours the presid and hi circl had ostens reason motiv for the refus to put himself up for elect again it is possibl that some peopl consid themselv to be the winner who as we all know are not judg be the victor you can natur permit yourself to go back on your word and dictat new condit of the polit game it cannot be rule out that the presid sincer believ in hi mission of transform of russia and want to use these year to arrang in the countri a better life as he see it in addit yeltsin who is not requir to delv into legal niceti may not sens the frailti of hi legal posit and becaus of thi doe not see the practic point of new elect the presid s circl howev is serious afraid of the possibl of hi not be reelect thi would mean for mani of them the end of their polit career for some an unpleas investig of financi matter and not just financi polit persecut and reveng are possibl also no one want to take such a risk under today s supercharg polit condit these peopl may be understood at the human level but in the highest interest of russia it is for all that imposs to agre with them the damag to the extrem imperfect russian statehood and to the genuin not selfishli misinterpret idea of democraci and a state base on the rule of law would be all too palpabl strictli speak the damag to the presid also would be inordin polit is a dirti immor busi no question but within certain bound which even the chines emperor could not transgress without loss of face nor could ani ruler think if onli to a neglig extent about hi good name no not about hi own even but that of hi countri and peopl it is as necessari as the air he breath thi is self evid to the person who consid himself the unifi and spokesman for the spirit of the nation societi and the state i believ that the presid will damag himself greatli if he goe back on hi promis to put himself up for elect again word under some condit count for a veri great deal but onli when they are not at varianc with deed word and deed russian exclaim in the old day wish to call the attent of the highest author to import state interest i believ that thi should be an inner requir of all statesmen declar themselv genuin spokesmen for the peopl s need and the presid should undoubtedli stand in the front row of these peopl
