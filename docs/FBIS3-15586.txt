interdepartment commiss for combat crime and corrupt which is head by minist of justic yuriy khamzatovich kalmykov thi commiss will in fact most like becom the coordin organ for the implement of the program repres of about 20 depart sit on thi commiss the feder program wa directli prepar and written by a group of 36 peopl they are well known academ lawyer execut and economist the program went

three version of the program were precis cost after all a program without resourc back is simpli a slogan the initi version wa a wish list it cost 16 trillion rubl r which wa clearli unrealist it wa necessari to lower our sight the second version cost somewher in the order of r10 trillion thi sum also prove to be out of the reach of the budget in connect with thi a disput aros in the interdepartment commiss between the leader of the law enforc depart and the financi law enforc offici state that they did not want to deceiv societi by project goal which were unattain without resourc
