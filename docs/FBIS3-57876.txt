moustach stand on end with these word more than 47 percent of what we produc end up in the state s coffer thi mean that each italian work from 1 januari to 28 juli for the govern and work for hi famili onli from 29 juli on the pd respons wa immedi sechi occhetto ha call your propos demagogueri and ha ad berlusconi should tell me how mani old peopl he want to turn out into the street how mani school and hospit he want to close what is your repli berlusconi what old peopl on the street how dare occhetto talk of old peopl he is the one who ha contribut to destroy the real valu of wage and pension by forc old peopl to live in poverti by be the accomplic of a system that should have been oppos and not support by an opposit parti my propos focus on increas wealth and employ in itali it ha been primarili the demagog choic made by the pci italian communist parti and the pd that have damag the nation economi sechi the tax ceil is just the foretast of a broader program for econom recoveri can you provid an outlin give an anticip of some point to our reader berlusconi the program we are work on is at an advanc stage and will be made public in due cours the onli anticip i feel like give is that it is a chang in cours compar to what ha happen over the past 10 15 year our object is to restor to italian the liberti that polit ha confisc from them it is a matter of free ourselv from the bureaucrat of societi and the politic of life sechi you are say stop the blank check to govern that devour money how can the italian say stop the leagu tri with their tax strike but with littl success berlusconi what i maintain is that when effect constitut rule are lack the peopl in govern are expos to the almost irresist temptat to acquir consensu and popular by abus public expenditur fortun tax revolt are rather rare event and can lead to undesir consequ if we want to avoid these we must set our hand to reform the state to move from a system base on trust in those govern to one that is base on the predict of well defin regul sechi you have been defin as be a fan of the capitalist far west but propos a tax code barrier rule doe thi not seem to be contradictori berlusconi the capitalist far west is a folklorist express use by those who have still not understood that the market is a rule i prefer a market economi and therefor it is perfectli in harmoni with my partial for constitut rule the support of the market economi are also the advoc of the state free trader in econom liber in polit when the left see a contradict between the market and rule it show that it is insuffici awar of the principl of a free economi sechi who may your travel companion against supertax be berlusconi i strongli doubt that today there is anybodi who is convinc that tax should be increas there is no self employ person shopown or businessman who is not awar of the fact that in itali there ha been an intoler abus of tax pressur the success of the leagu is one of the mani confirm of thi fact onli the left ha not realiz thi yet even if they are care not to openli suggest tax increas sechi miglio say that your program ha been copi word for word from that of the leagu berlusconi miglio know veri well that the introduct of a tax ceil is not someth new but ha been support for mani year and in the most vari countri howev the problem is not to determin the patern of the idea but rather to make it accept and translat into state legisl sechi the pd state that you could not care less about the deficit and that you want to maintain consumpt high to keep your group s revenu up berlusconi like befor the postcommunist are master in the art of misinform as for the deficit which is threaten the financi solvenc of our countri and to whose increas the postcommunist have larg contribut by propos ever increas expenditur the past year show that tax experi do not solv the problem tax have increas enorm but the deficit far from decreas ha also increas in order to balanc the govern budget one must do precis what the left doe not want to do cut public expenditur as for consumpt i am not the one who is say that privat consumpt ha decreas it is the offici figur final the fact that those ask that avail incom be restor to famili and worker are do so in their own interest and thi show how littl those of the left are worri about the well be of the italian sechi is the left eat balanc sheet or ha it realli convert itself to capit berlusconi everyth is possibl but is seem highli unlik that those who have preach statism and disdain the market economi and capit suddenli becom support of econom liberti if we ask ourselv whi the enemi of the market economi suddenli proclaim themselv liber and free trader the answer is obviou statism ha produc mourn and ruin wherev it wa attempt and it ha thrown such discredit upon itself that it is in nobodi s interest to proclaim oneself a statist sechi professor martino ha propos a pay packet without ani deduct and the abolit of withhold tax to unhing an old and oppress taxat system do you agre berlusconi the abolit of withhold tax would make worker know exactli how much tax they must pay onc again thi must be a rule tax must be clear and visibl whether thi will then contribut to chang the tax system depend on the taxpay reaction in determin the amount of tax that each ha to bear and primarili to what extent those in govern will take thi reaction into account sechi how can expens be reduc everyon ha tri but without success berlusconi there are expens that can be reduc immedi and expens that requir radic reform to be reduc but one thing is certain in order to reduc public expenditur it is first of all necessari to want to do thi even though thi is not suffici nobodi can deni that thi is a difficult task but it is not an imposs one if there is a desir to see it accomplish it is the task of polit to accomplish thing that are desir sechi do you think that the problem of tax evad can be resolv they say that you are their new robin hood berlusconi tax evas must be fought without hesit in order to have justic howev if we realli want to reduc evas and not limit ourselv to talk about it then we must act on the caus when incom tax are too high thi discourag the product of incom and encourag attempt to avoid pay them in variou way for thi reason i think that we will have to follow the exampl of mani countri such as sweden and the unit state which have reduc tax rate precis to reduc evas less exasper progress tax provid incent for product and increas state revenu as the experi of other countri ha confirm second if it is true that we have a great number of useless tax that do noth or littl for state revenu we should do away with them in do so we will simplifi the taxpay s life and the work of the tax author who could dedic themselv to see that the tax that realli contribut to increas revenu are paid in ani case though we cannot give up the battl against evas thi is certainli not the road to balanc the govern budget sechi if you were ciampi what would you have done in croton scene of industri unrest berlusconi what distinguish the statist from the politician is that the first is will to run the risk of becom unpopular in pursu the interest of all while the second doe not hesit in place hi polit career befor the interest of the public thi doe not mean that there are no except circumst that call for specif pragmat solut i onli want to say that these except must be rare and not part of normal behavior sechi let us talk about save how can you convinc the armi of bot govern bond peopl that you are not against them and abov all how can you convinc them to have faith in joint stock compani in the stock exchang berlusconi i realli do not see whi the peopl who hold govern bond should be afraid of those who have alway defend save and the right of ownership those that should be afraid are those that have tri to crimin these peopl for year by accus them of be parasit the owner of financi incom and respons for the balanc of payment problem italian saver will turn to share if the recoveri of the stock exchang can convinc them of the advantag of invest in share sechi prof raffaello lupi who is minist gallo s consult ha said berlusconi seem to be like zhirinovskiy he promis less tax and more vodka rather than einaudi accord to the left you are a demagogu whose onli expertis is debt what is your repli berlusconi i would like to remind you that zhirinovskiy is a postcommunist nationalist russian who call himself a liber democrat if there is somebodi that resembl these peopl it is not me it is those that have acclaim the soviet union for year and that now proclaim themselv democrat just like the tenant of bottegh oscur pd parti headquart as for the content of thi strang affirm i think that it confirm the import that the postcommunist give to the well be and liberti of the taxpay sechi when will you tast the bitter cup of polit berlusconi we will see perhap soon perhap never
