163 h5 to the reader h5 the feder assembl is begin it work at a crucial and dramat period of russia s histori the decis to be adopt by the legisl and execut organ of power will to a larg extent determin not onli russia s futur but also whether we will remain plung into crisi or whether a slow and pain recoveri will begin thi is the question let us recal that 1992 ha gone down in russia s histori as the year when mortal rate exceed birth rate for the first time ever in peacetim the situat deterior still further dure the first nine month of 1993 death have alreadi exceed birth by 500 000 the exist and surviv of the nation itself is in jeopardi befor a cure can be start it is necessari to arriv at an accur diagnosi in other word to apprais soberli and without prejudic the situat in which the countri find itself to understand the caus of such tragic event it is necessari to abandon the habit of make analysi and apprais fit in with the goal pursu by differ polit parti the interest of the countri and of the peopl as a whole must at long last come to the foreground in deed and not just in word on thi basi it will becom possibl to take the path toward accord between differ polit forc after all due to the exist split it is imposs to elabor a correct polici and pool effort to implement a joint program for extric from the crisi the follow must be one of the main principl of state polici at thi stage protect of the countri s nation interest on the basi of scienc pragmat and nation accord the author collect doe not in ani way claim that the materi it offer is consumm or complet we have attempt to identifi approach toward the solut of problem some of them are onli outlin in the text the import point is that those in whom the right to make decis is vest should be given an opportun to choos from the broadest possibl rang of substanti propos unfortun today there are frequent occas when incorrect and wrong decis are not onli propos but are also adopt with the consequ that the state and societi suffer afterward in order to avoid thi it is necessari to encourag by all possibl mean the elabor of variou draft and option for polit decis by independ expert and submit them for broad discuss such an approach is especi import when work on the complex problem of the state s secur and develop strategi sinc mani import question have hitherto been studi and practic resolv in isol and thi ha caus and continu to caus enorm harm it would seem for exampl that the correct decis to attain pariti with the nato countri ha result in a sharp weaken of econom secur the pursuit of gross indic and the lack of a systemat and intellig concept of the habitat have produc ecolog disast with the most seriou impact on the biospher as a result of anthropogen activ chernobyl territori in the far north and virtual all industri region all thi wa appar undertaken for the sake of the secur of the countri as a whole although it had a neg effect on it let alon the irrat expenditur of vast quantiti of materi resourc look at the latest exampl while talk about convers we have in realiti ruin the militari industri complex withdrawn from the world arm market and are now incur huge foreign currenc loss becaus the market ha been captur by the western countri to curb inflat how could anyon object to thi but the method use to implement thi concept have becom one of the factor paralyz the economi which ha led to strike and the shutdown of enterpris with all the ensu consequ neither the presid nor the feder assembl nor the govern nor ani other state organ compris the most compet and experienc peopl could elabor in depth and comprehens consid and adopt substanti decis on question of state secur unless the session of these organ are preced by a thorough scientif elabor of the problem under consider there is also a need for consult with scientif institut and lead scientist and specialist a seri of question also requir intern cooper becaus in our time it is imposs to contain the elabor of secur problem onli within the nation framework histori ha prove that it is imposs to achiev secur for the countri and peac and tranquil for it citizen by militari forc alon thi is easi to comprehend if the term secur is extrapol to the individu the nation the peopl the state and the intern commun a nation can achiev tranquil and function normal onli if it is confid that it will not be subject to devast by war and that it will not die out from an aid epidem or as a result of an ecolog crisi that it economi will undergo stabl develop and will not onli save the countri from famin and ruin but will also prevent ani potenti aggressor s illus about the likelihood of win a war against it that a develop system of legisl and legal will protect the nation from unbridl crime and will ensur the harmoni of the interest of all strata of societi of all peopl of russia and of each individu in thi special supplement to the rau corpor s inform and analysi weekli obozrevatel observ expert from center and author of the journal offer their own altern strategi for russia s extric from the crisi it is meant for peopl elabor and adopt polit decis or activ particip in their prepar primarili for deputi of russia s feder assembl thu thi supplement is a concept of russia s develop in 1994 and a kind of digest of idea and materi by the corpor s creativ collect with most profound respect for our subscrib reader and oppon sign doctor of histor scienc a podberezkin rau corpor presid and academician of the russian academi of natur scienc h5 nation secur russia in 1994 h5 today more than ever befor we need a critic analysi of the path we have travers and a clear object for societi s further develop after all we find ourselv at an histor crossroad there is no turn back but we still have to choos the new road within a veri brief period of time the countri ha move from one histor period to anoth there ha been a radic chang of state structur an end ha been put in russia to the previou polit system which wa underpin by the cpsu s monopoli of power and ideolog a headlong chang is under way in the correl of form of ownership in russia and correspondingli in the entir system of social interrel there is a grow accumul of interethn contradict within russia and of problem with former ussr republ which are now sovereign state there ha been a fundament chang in russia s posit in the world commun and in it mutual relat with foreign state in thi context it is necessari to clearli defin the current and long term russian nation interest which correspond with the interest of individu citizen and of societi as a whole it is necessari to highlight those on which the veri exist of our state depend in our view the main point today is to prevent the weaken and collaps of the russian state but how is thi to be avoid have defin the prioriti it would be expedi to elabor a program of reform in the interest of societi as a whole and not in the interest of individu group thi program will obvious be nationwid it must be comrehens realist and pragmat it must not be burden by ani polit bia citizen have the right and even the duti to know what kind of bright futur they are offer how will reform be implement and how long they will take they are fulli entitl not onli to ask question about all thi but also to altogeth disagre with the propos program and ultim to demand an account of the govern s activ the way to nation accord must be sought on the basi of respect for the individu and each citizen s right regardl of parti religi or nation affili what we need today is a govern capabl of find a way out of the crisi onli a program gear to the need of the major of the popul will enjoy the popul s support thi is also the onli way to achiev the consolid of all progress forc it is necessari to curb inflat restor confid in the rubl and creat a normal function financi state mechan gear to support for produc rather than for dealer how do we propos to begin first to abandon the excess of polit struggl and to strengthen legal law and order and elementari execut disciplin without which ani power is doom to anarchi in other word to strengthen the state second to undertak a seri of measur to improv live condit for the russian feder s citizen and primarili for the least well off section pension children the sick and those unabl to work third to uphold russia s uniti and it econom and polit independ fourth to reviv russia s spiritu potenti the main threat is the weaken of power and statehood ani weaken of ani of the branch of power mean the weaken of power and statehood as a whole it is extrem shortsight to sow the branch on which you are perch it would be much wiser to reciproc strengthen the repres execut and judici branch of power we offer for your attent an analysi of the situat and a packag of measur to strengthen the state h3 section i i preserv of civil peac of an integr and independ russian state h3 h6 1 preserv of civil peac and accord h6 arm conflict and local war are increasingli often wage along russia s border the fatherland is on the threshold of a war which could begin either on it border or beyond them it ha in fact alreadi begun therefor the main task today is to prevent it escal into all out war for thi purpos we need primarili nation uniti and accord no matter how the situat in the countri may develop it is impermiss to make the state depend on victori by differ view or polit forc politician and their ambit even the most outstand one come and go but russia live on ani polit victori would turn into defeat if a blow is dealt on statehood and societi slide toward confront it is imposs to achiev stabil and accord in societi unless an end is put to the divis into our and their into correct and guilti there is alreadi widespread use of the terminomoli and methodolog of psycholog warfar which are use dure prepar for the conduct of combat oper against oppon who will have to be sooner or later destroy the divis of citizen into victor and vanquish is a state crime becaus it lead directli to civil war in order to avoid thi and halt thi movement toward direct confront lead politician should be made to first abandon person parti interest in the conduct of affair and promot state interest to the foreground second to find within themselv the courag to ceas the endless search for enemi and declar the respons and repent of all for the catastroph which ha befallen russia our histori show that precis thi spiritu moral approach ha alway underpin russia s extric from crisi in thi context it is necessari to impos a direct legisl ban on the propaganda of enmiti equat it with call for civil war and introduc penalti for the public of unverifi inform detriment to the state and to civil peac but without prevent journalist engag in critic base on fact democraci and it principl must becom a mean for strengthen rather than weaken the state not a singl polit forc can or should claim to be absolut correct and consequ to exercis absolut power it is necessari to consolid all forc in societi without divid them into red white brown and so on thi approach ha prove pernici for our statehood over the last few decad the econom chao today ha been compound by interethn conflict the collaps of moral foundat and cultur heritag and final the crisi of polit power instead of a middl class which in all civil societi compris the scientif technic and creativ intelligentsia skill worker and entrepreneur we have creat a minut privileg stratum of dealer while the remain strata are undergo headlong lumpen at no time and in no place ha thi path ever creat a reliabl support for democraci and state power in societi it is paradox but for mani year on end the state ha pursu an antist polici aim at the disintegr and elimin of it most import institut the armi nation domest polici and the state secur system the most acut problem face the state today are a to prevent a civil war b to strengthen the state institut c to prevent russia s collaps d to overcom the socioeconom crisi and save the nation e to preserv scienc cultur and educ cadr pose an especi acut problem when promot peopl to the lever of state administr societi envisag a system of measur to train administr cadr all over the world includ prerevolutionari russia ani citizen who wish to becom a profession politician ha to go through the school of upbring educ and practic befor he is allow access to polit activ in local organ of power in order to be launch into state level orbit the candid ha to climb a long ladder of practic work and train in the unit state befor a citizen can hold promin offic he is polish in a prestigi univers and in the cours of work abroad in the ministri includ the state depart and the cia or parti apparatu in congress and so on the result is a skill functionari meet the need of hi societi s rule circl but even here mistak cannot be avoid the polar of polit forc and their grow confront take the most uncivil form in russia not onli did not end with the elimin of the russian feder suprem soviet but are actual intensifi the elect campaign consider stimul thi process consequ it is probabl that one section of the rule elit will succeed in crystal into a clearli defin parti structur which will attempt to establish control first over the govern and then over the presid de facto reviv the one parti polit system the access of such a parti to power will in turn inevit lead first to a clash between the presid and the feder assembl and then to a leadership struggl within the rule parti itself unfortun the histori of the ussr and the cpsu offer us numer tragic exampl of such develop of event in thi context from the state s point of view there is need for measur for legisl and polit regul of parti activ make provis for temporari suspens of the activ of all parti and sociopolit organ in the event that the natur of their polit activ becom damag to the state s secur thi kind of decis and thi is of fundament import must be made and monitor by the suprem organ of state power subject to one immut condit polit decis must under no circumst becom the prerog of execut and monitor organ like the mvd ministri of intern affair the ministri of secur the prosecutor s offic and so on in our view the ideal author to make such decis would be the judiciari the real strengthen of the aithor and potenti of the judiciari must becom a prioriti task in russia s state build base our analysi on the suprem interest of the state and the nation we have conclud that firm author is need today the most effect indisput and bloodless form for russia could be an interim presidenti rule monitor by the feder assembl if we were to leav asid polit bia and the ambit of polit leader and forc desir to make capit out of discord in russia we are confid that mani of our fellow citizen would agre even an imperfect leader of the nation is better than a group of polit leader look primarili after their own interest and corrupt element strain to come to power dure the most difficult time in russia s histori feudal strife invas the time of troubl the countri emerg victori have mobil all it resourc and the spiritu potenti of the mass under a singl leader s leadership the soviet era wa no except see that stalin s dictatorship wa object a posit factor of victori in world war ii and of the countri s reemerg from the ruin the press occasion write that russia today feel not onli the urgent need but even the inevit of the appear of an authoritarian regim capabl of extric the countri from the crisi some peopl assum that russia ha alreadi taken thi path and therefor the question is not how to avoid a transit to authoritarian but to choos it most accept form and the method for transit we it is said have alreadi diverg from the possibl form and norm of a develop democrat state in the transit period it is therefor necessari to accept thi fact as an object exist realiti and second to tri and find a method peac and the one most accept for the state of transit to one of the more prefer form of authoritarian thi assum that new qualiti will be demand of the repres of the authoritarian form of rule leader of the nation rather than of a parti staunch defend of the state and it interest rather than leader of reform a builder rather than a destroy in other word a major revis of the prioriti and valu which have been domin in the last few year the list of these charact qualiti could be logic extend to includ a seriou chang in the disposit of polit forc the transform of recent alli and friend into polit oppon and the obvers the attract of broad strata of profession and specialist not commit to ani one polit parti or movement it may happen that instead of authoritarian we could end up with incess struggl intrigu by differ group parti and junta and attempt coup with the state and the nation at stake ani such struggl which ha becom an accept form of exist for these leader and a part of their essenc will inevit and for a long time to come hinder and delay the stabil of the situat in the countri and will weaken our might the countri s earliest possibl extric from the crisi and the gradual format of durabl democrat foundat of a civil societi are import for russia becaus real democraci is possibl onli in a societi where there are no mortal threat against the state and the nation h6 2 improv of the feder structur prevent of region fragment h6 what should russia be like follow the disappear of the superpow the soviet union from the world map it former constitut call it the russian feder but is thi realli true a genuin feder is possibl onli when two or sever state are unit and as a rule it is base on last integr without the right to seced the autonomi of a union state s compon is guarante insofar as it doe not threaten the state s uniti precis thi principl wa use in form the major of feder state exist today the unit state switzerland canada germani true enough some other state also style themselv as feder argentina brazil mexico venezuela india and spain for exampl essenti howev they are unitari state with a certain amount of autonomi for their provinc pseudofeder in the classic sens of the word world experi ha shown that a durabl feder state is possibl onli when it is form by autonom state keen to unit by dint of variou vital import reason more recent histor exampl alreadi prove that ani attempt to creat a feder out of immatur nation and territori format inevit engend instabl and disintegr which swiftli lead to the collaps of newli form state or the format of a unitari state the soviet union wa a feder onli in name proclaim by it constitut but in essenc wa in our view a typic pseudofeder it is well known that a treati between a seri of republ wa conclud in 1922 but in the strict jurid and legal sens not a singl one of the compon agre to the union wa a state as for the rsfsr russian soviet feder socialist republ as one of the contract parti to the creation of the ussr from the veri begin it wa also a pseudofeder both in form and in it inner composit the conclus of the feder treati in it present form did not solv the problem either with whom did the feder compon conclud the treati with the feder state structur to be precis if they repres a singl state it emerg that the russian it numer largest peopl compris more than 80 percent of the popul are dispers among the feder compon sinc their own statehood is not even mention furthermor tatarstan and the chechen republ did not sign the feder treati while the stanc of a seri of republ and region as regard the distribut of power is threaten the russian feder s uniti it is fair to ask is the newli emerg russia not a wors variat of the same old pseudofeder it ha to be object note that ever sinc the collaps of the russian empir the ethnic russian have been gradual lose their statehood thi is the fundament question of our commun s develop in view of all that ha been said abov will russia be abl to becom a genuin feder state the fatherland s histori contain sever exampl of attempt to impos a feder unif of territori dure the kievan period right until the invas by the golden hord dure the suzdal muscovi period dure the time of troubl and in 1917 right after the februari revolut it is of cours possibl today to blame the soviet power for fail to take everyth into consider when form the sovereign republ but the main point is that mani peopl acquir or restor their statehood precis thank to the soviet power the pull toward integr and uniti of the peopl of both russia and the former ussr stem from numer factor the territori which they inhabit eurasia throughout the mani centuri of their exist these peopl have on mani occas unit within state format and have produc uniqu cultur and singl spiritu area they perceiv eurasia as their motherland contin whose fate is insepar from the fate of each one of it peopl experi show that whenev the eurasian ethnic group have fail to reach accord their land have becom easi prey for aggressor the struggl for eurasia s repartit could disrupt the world geopolit equilibrium and caus a global catastroph anoth common featur of russia s peopl is the highli polyetnn natur of all newli form state onli six of the multitud of russian peopl claim more than 50 percent of indigen popul in their republ the chuvash account for 69 percent the tuvinian for 64 percent the komi permyak for 60 percent the chechen for 58 percent the buryat in aga buryat autonom okrug for 54 percent and the ossetian for 53 percent the averag indigen popul in all russian feder republ is 32 percent and even less 10 5 percent in autonom okrug it is simpli imposs to divid all thi into some sort of state format the follow conclus suggest itself russia s peopl are destin to live in one state feder in spirit and form so what are the way to solv the nation state question in russia there are two main danger appar in the possibl develop of nation process today the first is the uncontrol explos of russian nation as a natur defens reaction to the threat of russia s fragment and to the insult of nation digniti take the form of the russophobia and chauvin typic of some former union republ and of individu nation region in russia itself but the establish of nationalist dictatorship is no solut the lament experi of such dictatorship and regim in a seri of state which emerg on the territori of the ussr offer convinc proof of thi territori and state collaps is as a rule the price that ha to be paid for the triumph of nation idea the second danger lie in the attempt to turn russia back to it prerevolut state structur divid it into guberniya in practic term thi would mean the forc colon of nation republ the right which non russian peopl have acquir can no longer be withdrawn or curtail without tragic consequ for them and for the russian nation russian or ani other nation will not onli lead inevit to the destruct of russia s integr but will also render the statehood of these veri peopl just a pipedream the ideal way to a genuin feder state is to conclud a full blood feder treati between the republ russia s kray and oblast as feder compon must enjoy equal right with the republ with a possibl subsequ establish of new integr format guberniya laender the more extens the level of self govern the more last will be the real integr between feder compon includ the russian region the comprehensivess of thi integr elimin the problem of the russian nation s possibl self dismember in the event that kray and oblast are elev to the level of republ thu feder could be found simultan on the nation state nation territori and territori principl which would be most in line with russia s specif featur there is need to constitut enshrin the right of nation group and the guarante of cultur autonomi in thi process it will be import to sensibl distribut power between central and local organ of power and administr sinc the two organ of power parliament and govern combin all the origin featur of a multin state in the person of deputi and member of the govern they would appear to personifi to a larg extent the compon of the feder and their peopl and then the center s authoritarian within the limit of it power would be accept with understand on the other hand authoritarian in the form of a presidenti republ in russia s specif condit could spark off conflict which would be diffitul to overcom and in the event of the adopt of decis which may be disadvantag for some of it compon it may even prompt nation agit and protest nonetheless experi show that at critic moment in histori authoritarian as a temporari measur may be necessari and furthermor justifi the format of a genuin feder russian state will offer an opportun to reviv the larg lost tie with nearbi foreign countri the time and extent of thi new rapproch of peopl from the former ussr will depend primarili on russia s stabil and prosper thi will happen sooner or later and when it doe the eurasian contin will see the emerg of a new commun of free peopl and state qualit differ from all other in the past mainli due to the genuin feder principl underpin it build if oblast even enlarg one ural republ far east republ and so on were to be given the right to have their own parliament constitut embassi and so on thi would run contrari to both intern experi and common sens ani sovereign of administr oblast in today s condit will lead to the feder s transform into a confeder in light of the current weaken of power thi would be the quickest way to the state s collaps with all the ensu econom and social consequ which would be extrem seriou for all evid of thi can be seen in the consequ of the soviet union s collaps a strengthen of separat is also possibl even if compon do not formal seced from the feder someth which can alreadi be notic today what attitud should be taken toward the strive of the leadership of some sovereign republ to take advantag of the feder state s weaken so as to expand their right still further and acquir a special statu in the feder someth like associ member practic ha convincingli confirm that ani excess expans of compon right lead to a weaken and even the collaps of the feder case of secess from the feder by joint accord of all interest side are isol the state of singapor from malaysia other attempt secess have usual been put down by forc the sonderbund in switzerland the southern state in the unit state biafra in nigeria and so on and even if they did succeed on occas thi wa the result of militari oper against the feder the separ of bangladesh from pakistan in 1970 natur thi way to preserv the state s uniti is unaccept to us the state laender or provinc compris feder abroad usual exercis onli the right which have been either vest in them by the central power or enshrin in the constitut on the basi of agreement between the compon there is a tendenc toward curtail the scope of these right they do not enjoy independ in intern affair there are numer instanc when decis by the suprem court of such feder directli indic that their compon are not sovereign canada australia in nigeria and with a view to block ani ethnic separat the state territori ha been reshap in such a way as to give them a nation heterogen popul mix neither the constitut nor the feder treati of the russian feder make provis for the compon right to seced from the feder and self determin is exercis within the framework of a feder state which is not bound to uncondit grant to a republ s popul the right to separ even if such a demand ha been back by the major of the popul in a referendum ani such referendum is unlaw and it result can have onli a polit not a legal signific the threat to seced from the feder which can be heard everi now and again run contrari to both the constitut and the feder treati therefor they have no legal effect and in our view ought to be resolut cut short bear in mind the vast advantag which the republ have alreadi gain thank to their membership of the russian feder their leader ought to abandon their attempt to further expand their right to the point which is tantamount to secess while the legitim right of republ and oblast ought to be cover by addit treati with the feder the forc of law is better than the law of forc the law enabl it use the extent of feder compon right is determin not through barter or some sort of deal result in their curtail or expans it is clearli predetermin by the demand stem from the principl of self determin it is impermiss to expand the right of compon at the expens of the interest of other nation and all peopl of the feder which also enjoy these right the principl of self determin protect the interest of all peopl and curb nation egot thi is precis whi it remain the basi of nation polici both in the russian feder and in the world commun life ha prove that ani reject of the feder on a nation basi is in our countri at least imposs today further advanc toward the feder can take the form of more effect protect of individu nation right educ of peopl in a spirit of cooper and solidar use of two or even three offici languag the strengthen of legal and so on h6 3 elimin of the seat of interethn conflict h6 the present statu of interethn relat in the russian feder and throughout the former soviet union s territori can be describ as a zone of ethnic calam undergo a complex crisi where domest and geopolit factor are intertwin the economi s normal structur

declin of confid in them and in their author which underpin the legitimaci of ani democrat power thi appli not just to ani singl branch of power but to state power as such without ani distinct be drawn between progress democrat conserv legisl execut or judiciari their fruitless confront onli aggrav the discredit of the state and of power as such it appear that the collaps of the ussr wa neither predestin nor inevit despit claim by the architect of the collaps the selfsam process of disintegr are today gather pace also in the russian feder in addit to the most complex knot of interethn contradict we have inherit from the past equal acut problem develop as consequ of the current state of the economi social life polit and the law these conflict are reproduc with grow acut and on an expand scale a most import role here is play by polit and ideolog factor the shoot of democraci and of civil econom and polit togeth with the peopl s hope for nation rebirth have in mani instanc becom hostag of extremist forc sundri polit adventur and crimin and corrupt structur mani nation movement which emerg as forc pursu the goal of preserv and reviv their peopl s spiritu origin and ensur their social cultur and linguist surviv have now descend to polit radic and extrem anarchi and squabbl at feder level lead to the emerg of would be local dictat play the card of separat

onli yesterday accus the union center and at time even the whole russian peopl of colon them and trampl their nation right are today cynic take action which transform peopl of other nation and primarili the russian speak popul into second class peopl into outcast experi show that unless the nation problem with which the extremist specul are resolv from abov in rel civil form they will be resolv from below in distort form despit all the critic of the feder treati it is a compromis an attempt to consolid the balanc of interest on the one hand it is intend to guarante the process of self govern by peopl live in feder compon against unjustifi administr bureaucrat interfer by the center while on the other hand it is intend to prevent ani nation or religi diktat on the state and offer a guarante against ani action ultim lead to russia s destruct as an integr unifi state encroach against the feder treati continu to thi day it destruct will pave the way to a new round of polit confront and fruitless struggl russia s tradit even under the toughest regim have alway includ the preserv of divers in the self govern of peopl and territori thi polit divers is attain onli if the nation

compris violent arm attempt to reshap the exist ethnopolit area it is obviou that thi develop lead to disintegr of all polit social and technolog tie contemporari yugoslavia is an exampl the second model is associ with the reintegr of totalitarian thi violent way of deal with the nation problem can take the form of militari nationalist regim ethnojunta the most neg consequ would stem from the establish in russia of a nationalist regim with the ensu restor of a neo imperi system throughout the geopolit area the third model is the sole peac altern presuppos a democrat develop ethnic tension is eas through the build of feder state in a seri of former union republ on a democrat rather than a nation basi in thi process tie between the independ republ could be built accord to the model of permeabl and toler sovereignti the desir to prevent an econom collaps in post soviet state and a complet break of technolog tie between them and to eas pressur by the russian factor in former union republ will intensifi in the face of the threat that nationalist regim may be establish it would be possibl within the third model s framework to halt the catastroph disintegr of the union econom area and to prevent the violent arm dismember of the singl ethnic area on the territori of the former ussr in our view it is from these posit that the russian state posit on the question of the russian

1995 accord to forecast by the russian academi of scienc nation econom forecast institut the restor of the protect and reproduct function for russian is the sovereign state s basic task in what form should these function be restor on a new basi on the basi of democraci and market relat howev commit to democraci and market relat by itself is not a state idea which can unit multin russia in a unifi state the birth of specif method of transform just like of a state idea is pain nowaday have to fight through the complex of the past and the contradict of the present the basic criteria in thi process could be the minim of social loss the spiritu humanist and moral orient of transform and the balanc of the interest of the world commun and of the russian feder s peopl today just like in 1991 russia is face the task of how to realli becom sovereign an analysi of the past two year show increasingli clearli that not a singl one of the ni includ russia wa prepar either polit or econom or psycholog for sovereign exist the end of 1991 saw the format of 15 protost without border armi monetari system infrastructur state or nation interest full blood economi and so on it ought to be conclud that even today not a singl one of these state is full blood in thi sens consequ in 1994 just as in the two preced year their develop will be determin by the follow block of problem a complet the format of sovereign state with all state attribut b creat an effect system of mutual relat between the ni c join the polit militari econom and other system exist in the world open presuppos meet the other state halfway establish new mutual relat with them and expand the sphere of these relat convers sovereign of each ni and it separ from the union would mean draw away from it former neighbor in the commun state a certain step up of autarki breakdown of exist tie and alien thi contradict determin the logic of mutual relat between the ni which develop in two opposit direct first there wa an increasingli notic manifest of interst relat establish of custom regim and border most republ the baltic countri ukrain kyrgyzstan moldova georgia azerbaijan belaru kazakhstan are introduc either nation currenc or ersatz money on the basi of autonom emiss the financi system is be structur balanc of payment and trade are be determin the former ussr s foreign debt asset and liabil are be divid debt account is be establish and so on second integr feel are grow or at least the desir for an earli break is weaken in most former republ except latvia and estonia and partli lithuania and turkmenistan nonetheless today it is still prematur to talk of integr or disintegr what we are observ for the time be is the coexist not of the ni but of real author at differ level in these ni for exampl how is it possibl to treat as part of russian kazakhstani relat the tripartit polit econom union of kazakhstan tatarstan and bashkortostan which wa sign in august 1992 and under which bashkortostan ceas deliv oil product to russian depart in 1994 it will be necessari either to make effort to place russia s relat with the ni on the firm basi of intern law or to creat suprast structur with power of author it is more than like that both form will develop in the immedi futur the format of civil relat between the ni will be influenc by the follow factor the incomplet disintegr of the ussr as a result of which the subject of interst relat have not been final defin it is possibl that their number may be either increas if separat intensifi in russia moldova georgia ukrain and so on or reduc if the process of integr are intensifi two fundament differ principl are clearli manifest the nation territori separ into autonom republ and nation territori format and the region separ into pure russian region analysi show that the russian feder s disintegr will hardli end up as a sovereignti bandwagon of autonom format the indigen etnnic group repres even a rel major in onli 11 out of the 31 nation territori format separatist mood are intensifi in proper russian region in the far east the ural kuban siberia thi ha not been observ either in the ni or in east european countri the follow forecast can be made for 1994 retent of an economi with a price structur out of kilter with world price in 1993 russia suppli product to the ni at price equival to 30 40 percent of world price while purchas from them at price equival to 70 percent of world price and consequ russia had a posit balanc of about 750 billion rubl in trade with the ni in the first six month deterior of the situat of etnnic russian in the ni have becom an ethnic minor there the situat is be aggrav by the fact that virtual all the ni be multin have opt for the nationalist idea in strengthen the state lukewarm attitud of the world commun primarili of the g 7 countri toward individu ni and the structur of mutual relat prevail in the post soviet area it ought to be note in thi context that first in 1992 1993 the major of ni lost their illus about western aid but certain hope remain that some would be integr within the ec while other would draw closer to asian countri and would enjoy their support second there is a steadili grow econom depend on the west and third there is an increasingli clearli manifest tendenc by the west to pursu mainli it own interest in relat with the ni for exampl squeez russia out of the arm market and other technolog market increas purchas of energi sourc from russia at the expens of deliveri to nearbi foreign countri and so on sever system of collabor between the ni will be form in 1994 in one way or anoth prioriti is be given to the problem of structur the geopolit area with the aim of boost stabil in the region and the manag of polit process h6 5 way to form a civil societi h6 term like civil societi and citizen have been increasingli activ use in our vocabulari recent wherea in the past these term were virtual unencount in

and other public relat the product and privat live of peopl their custom tradit and moral the sphere of self govern of free individu and their organ protect by the law against direct interfer therein by state power and polit it is the civil societi that destroy the statesmen s monopoli on power and balanc state power with the power of privat individu and independ organ a highli develop civil

variou polit group and variou social strata of the popul from a sounder point of view it can be seen that a chang of govern and of author in gener will inevit result in replac the immatur inconsist at

packag of problem severalfold there is no doubt that all these neg factor and their impact on the financi system will persist also in 1994 at the same time there are also the mistak and error commit recent which call for special mention the last two year have shown that the overcom of the slump in product and the acceler of structur chang in russia s nation economi cannot be guarante exclus by the mean of monetari and credit polici furthermor such an approach is flaw in it veri foundat in the condit of inflat the capit of enterpris and bank are be swiftli devalu while credit oper are be essenti curtail even though the indic without ani adjust for inflat speak of an appar growth of credit oper and foreign currenc on balanc sheet if they were to be adjust for inflat they would be sharpli reduc the main caus of inflat are the sharp declin of product the arbitrari price set by enterpris in condit of monopol and commod shortag the budget deficit the breakdown of econom tie with enterpris in former union republ and cema countri and the export of russian commod at dump price these are the factor that lead to an imbal between the money in circul and the commod avil for purchas error in the implement of econom reform and the super rigid monetarist credit polici togeth with confus in calcul have intensifi the slump in product and fuel inflat the main lever for hold inflat back ought to be the credit support for viabl enterpris if enterpris do not receiv credit to meet product cost and cover defer payment they would be altogeth unabl to function and due to mass product stoppag inflat would be mani time greater in condit that encourag incess price increas and declin of the rubl s purchas power it is imposs to achiev normal commod money circul includ the mainten of balanc between the total price of commod in circul and the total amount of money releas into circul what should be the specif measur that would make it possibl to satisfi the commod market at price accept by the major of the popul one of the strateg solut is to restrict the amount of money in circul last year thi result in a huge total of reciproc nonpay price went up and the enterpris money evapor but credit emiss is still be curtail by whip up interest rate the rubl s purchas power is fall uncontrol becaus price are rise without restraint the imbal between the valu of commod in circul and the total amount of money in circul is widen in a normal econom process money serv as a technic mean of payment when exchang for commod if there is no money commod money circul is slow down and disrupt sinc commod product is curtail although everyon cite the need for credit emiss to be held back by the central bank commod produc enterpris are in debt thi is confirm by the correl of the growth of price and of money in circul over a two year period the former increas by a factor of between 100 and 1 000 while the total amount of money increas onli by a factor of 10 to 15 while commod produc are cut back and curtail product the budget deficit is grow at a mad pace each year but how are the state s inordin rise expens to be cover if the enterpris revenu are fall and consequ budget revenu from taxat are reduc the differ approxim 20 trillion rubl will have to be cover by money emiss thi reveal the main caus of inflat budget expenditur are begin to exceed the total valu of commod produc for circul but we cannot avoid deliber and control inflationari expenditur on invest and the product of commod produc even five year ago the countri would have need trillion of rubl to replac worn out equip and thu ensur simpl reproduct thi account for 50 to 60 percent of all fix asset in product at today s price the amount of money need would be 1 000 time greater without restor the fix asset we will be unabl to build a market economi and solv social problem meanwhil invest in the last two year have been scanti furthermor a sizeabl proport ha been devalu becaus the invest period span sever year invest in product have been reduc by a factor of about five compar with the minimum that is necessari enterpris are consum their depreci reserv let alon their profit thi is yet anoth consequ of irrespons and the fals percept of econom freedom evid we should not count on the foreign credit that have been promis therefor in order to reviv the economi we will be unabl to manag without inflationari credit emiss but a credit emiss that is accur verifi and control it must be note that in a healthi econom system high interest rate are set in order to reduc inflat in our own condit today high interest rate prompt a faster pace of price increas and further devalu of money fast growth of commod product can be achiev by lower interest rate while acceler the turnov of fund and provid target credit for the economi thi mean an econom effect for both creditor and commod produc thi is the way to extric ourselv more swiftli from the grip of inflat but we will chang noth in our life today without solv the gener question of financi and econom polici without establish firm rule of the game it is after all no secret mani peopl are in favor of a market without rule primarili middlemen trader and dealer as well as some commerci bank with their high interest rate for credit fund by their borrow from the central bank which itself set the tone in thi sphere the rule of the game in the market today can be establish onli by gener agreement between all side thi is normal behavior in develop countri the destruct of what ha alreadi been creat will continu without such an agreement without ani organ principl h5 the monetari credit system h5 the dispar between the bank system model in russia and other countri is the main caus hinder their integr in a singl financi area the model appli in russia are substanti differ from the model of the world s bank busi and encourag the specul commerci accumul of capit rather than it invest in product suppli commod to the market the second import reason hinder the integr of the russian and the world s monetari credit system is the underdevelop of modern long term form of settlement in russia in these condit the attempt to elabor the best possibl cours in credit polici and reform the system of settlement in the nation economi is perceiv by the central bank of russia as a prioriti task the object of the bank of russia s monetari credit polici are enshrin in the basic guidelin of monetari credit regul in 1993 ratifi by the suprem soviet and in the 24 may 1993 econom polici statement by the govern and the central bank both document set the main task of slow down inflat which devalu the popul s money incom and save deform product and trade and distort econom guidelin for particip in econom relat proceed from the premis that the rate of inflat depend on the rate of money suppli it ought to be expect that after a certain time lag credit restrict should result in a slow down of price increas but inflat stood at 20 percent in june 22 percent in juli 26 percent in august and 23 percent in septemb dure the first nine month of 1993 wholesal and consum price increas by a factor of 7 3 and 6 3 respect thu the basic approach toward the curb of inflat ha prove useless the rise price of energi sourc of ga in februari and of coal in juli remain the main factor of inflat the monopoli statu of individu group of produc provid the main caus of the acceler increas of wholesal price and after a brief interv of consum price as well inflat in russia is expect to reach 900 to 1 000 percent in 1993 as a whole the state of the monetari credit sphere remain veri complex it is not onli instabl in the economi but also uncertainti as regard the state budget that hinder ani forecast of the futur dynam of growth of the money in circul and consequ ani effect regul of it level in order to ensur a stabl reduct of the rate of inflat the central bank s action ought to be back by an appropri budgetari and taxat polici the ineffici distribut of central credit is fraught with the danger that a new crisi of nonpay might develop larg scale financi inject might be requir in order to avoid it and thi in it turn will lead to an expans of unsatisfi effect demand and higher rate of inflat the graviti of thi threat is prove even more graphic by the fact that 40 percent of central credit receiv by enterpris are use by them to cover current debt it is necessari to enhanc the effici of supervis and control of the activ of commerci bank when financ region program it is necessari to util the potenti of credit partnership and the advantag of mortgag credit and to creat municip bank as regard target state credit these fund ought to be primarili channel into the implement of specif project associ with the develop of

be commit today attempt are made to restrain inflat by virtual noth but monetarist method by rais the base rate and rigidli limit the credit for enterpris and yet the rubl s strength depend mainli on the statu of materi product and the balanc of the state budget so far the economi in russia ha not been function as a self tune mechan therefor it is of cours a mistak to appli all the method which oper in a develop market economi in these condit a moder tough credit polici would be the most appropri it must be tough but nonetheless we have no right to depriv the healthi nucleu of the countri s economi of credit overnight there is the especi urgent question of the concept of the further develop and build of our nation bank system russia ha approxim 1 800 commerci bank 88 percent of which are small and medium bank with a registr capit of up to 100 million rubl their interest must also be taken into account after all there is no uncommit money in russia no such money is held by the

even expect to increas their staff nonetheless about 40 percent of banker report possibl cutback in their servic for state enterpris 72 percent believ that the financi econom situat of their client in the state sector will deterior more than one third of bank do not expect their deposit base to be boost by state enterpris almost all bank report that they do not plan ani cutback in credit for commerci structur in 1994 in thi process they will give prefer to short term credit the commerci bank are strive to expand the sphere of their oper but the invest of the bank own fund in commerci enterpris is a high risk oper that could lead to a reduct of their capit avail and the emerg of difficulti with liquid and solvenc furthermor in individu case the bank use for such purpos not onli their own fund but also fund attract from their client thu expos not onli themselv but also their depositor to addit risk in thi context the bank of russia plan to submit a propos on amend to bank legisl as regard limit the proport of the bank s own capit be util and the format of regist capit by other nonbank legal entiti we need to work on a law on bank and bank oper and the central bank and

would realli creat prerequisit for the preserv of their nation tradit languag cultur and nation self awar we perceiv thi prospect as the develop of econom cultur and polit trend aim against ani attempt to establish reactionari ethnocrat regim on the vast space of the former union it is of cours hardli possibl to reli on object reintegr tendenc for reviv that which ha collaps under the weight of accumul contradict and gross error by shortsight politician there is no subjunct mood in histori there is howev an altern to such a develop of event but it is lament it is first the loss of econom independ by the newli form state includ russia follow the disintegr of the singl econom area and the nation econom complex which wa unifi until the recent past their distinct western and their transform into underdevelop appendag of major western countri with a mafia crimin domest econom and polit structur it is second the intent or unintent flare up of inter nation or interethn conflict either as a result of the exacerb and deterior of the socioeconom situat and the impoverish of broad strata of the popul or due to the insolubl of question pertain to nation state belong of variou territori militari properti and other categori of former union properti if the gravest of consequ for all our peopl are to be avoid it is imposs to ignor in polit the thousand year old trend toward ethnic and ethnocultur develop and collabor as a result of which a special type of eurasian civil start develop a long time ago across the space of russia and it associ territori the preserv of one s own state ident today is a question not onli of human digniti but also of polit wisdom all these chang will inevit have an impact on million of russian and their rel in russia it is natur that such a turn of event will inevit prompt a social explos includ and let us have no illus on thi account in russia itself and will becom a power factor for the develop of interst conflict pretend not to realiz thi mean directli encourag such a develop of event h6 2 polit aspect h6 a legitim way out of the situat from all point of view could be provid onli by restor of the common econom cultur and legal area uncondit remov of trade barrier introduct of benefit for member of the new econom and defens union adopt of common citizenship in the ninth year of perestroyka and after three year of democrat russia lack a clear foreign polici concept there ha been no definit of russia s prioriti or a concept of the new integr cooper across the former ussr thi is precis whi the sluggish activ of the ci ha produc no posit result russia s nation prioriti must inde be the interest of the peopl of the russian feder and of the largest among them the russian peopl which ha for centuri been russia s unifi nucleu and ha alreadi prove it consolid role consequ all diplomat foreign polit and foreign econom effort must focu primarili on russia s allianc with the former union republ which have a larg proport of russian and russian speak popul they are primarili ukrain kazakhstan belaru estonia latvia uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and moldova thi will make it possibl to solv the problem of almost 90 percent of ethnic russian and of mani russian citizen who are resid in these state it is in russia s nation interest and regardless of the russian diaspora s size to further strengthen the allianc with central asian republ which have prove their commit to the idea of uniti at the most critic time for russia h6 3 toward integr via coordin h6 there is an impress that out of the entir packag of problem on whose solut the ci ought to be work attent today is focus onli on two aspect the suppli of russian raw materi and fuel to the ni and the combat involv of russian troop under ci auspic in conflict on the territori of the former ussr and yet the question of paramount import for the peac period of develop settl the issu of citizen right are hardli ever on the agenda the ci today certainli need an organ capabl of coordin humanitarian question and eas the pressur of state border on the collect and individu right of citizen of ani nation the ci collect organ could also coordin the process of reform it is hard to reviv our econom mechan while differ part of the ci implement diverg concept of transit to market economi like for exampl when the western republ adher to the genuin sensibl limit of initi privat while russia is engag exclus in macroprivat the destat of harbor and airport oil and gold field and industri giant the problem that could be resolv onli within the framework of a singl socioeconom area are consider more numer than it might appear at first glanc the problem of refuge whose solut presuppos specif a system of sanction against republ whose democrat liber polici pose a threat to peopl s surviv and to the guarante of their elementari right as well as the provis of complet secondari and higher educ in the nativ languag togeth with question concern the pension provis for peopl who work in the ussr and are now live in ci state no matter how sad thi may be to admit but the initi built in disintegr factor still domin the concept of the ci two year later the reason is the lack of a concept of unif of a backbon around which a real as oppos to a nomin commun may be develop russian and european experi alik show that a real and dynam foundat for the re creation of a singl humanitarian econom and defens area can be provid by the interest of ethnic minor detach from their nucleu includ the largest among them the russian a concept capabl of switch the ci to the track of construct collabor will emerg onli when we abandon the demagogueri abour russian chauvin and all the other tag recent attach to the nation which succeed in realli ralli the peopl on one sixth of the earth s surfac h6 4 problem of migrat h6 without a forecast of the true extent of migrat it is difficult to determin what financi resourc will be requir to compens refuge and forc migrant for the damag they have suffer and to provid facil for new settler the number of job that will have to be creat for them the real burden that will be impos on the social infrastructur at place where migrant will concentr and so on the return of russian from former ussr republ and the migrat of repres of non russian peopl to russia began long befor interethn tension reach the stage of open conflict and becam a bargain chip in polit struggl even back in 1979 1988 the posit balanc of the migrat to russia by russian who had formerli activ resettl in other republ wa in excess of 300 000 the growth of the scale of migrat wa also affect by the outflow of nonindigen peopl from region where non russian titular ethnic group had concentr in russia itself the northern caucasu the volga valley the siberian transbayk region and the northern belt of the feder in essenc these region show the selfsam symptom of discrimin against repres of nontitular ethnic group as in nearbi foreign countri among the advers consequ of mass migrat realli great import attach to the growth of social stress there is a signific deterior of the social awar of migrant themselv who have lost their former statu and quit often the prospect of social success there is also dissatisfact among the resid of town and villag where they live unfortun the help given to forc migrant or refuge by the local organ of power and popul is clearli inadequ the attempt by migrant to acquir a social nich in the new local come up against seriou object difficulti the level of social tension ha increas wherev refuge are concentr as soon as they have appear thi is note both by the migrant themselv and by local resid the social and psycholog atmospher in which refuge find themselv is also indic by the result of a poll of the popul in 13 russian feder region when ask what polici do you support the answer were distribut as follow as percentag of the number poll accept citizen of all former ussr republ regardless of their nation 36 percent accept onli russian by descent 51 percent do not accept anyon 11 percent did not answer 2 percent one out of everi 10 person poll is against the accept of migrant while one half of those poll are inclin toward divid refuge and migrant into our peopl and foreign these stereotyp of mass and individu awar cannot be ignor they were graphic demonstr in practic in saratov and volgograd oblast dure the discuss of the question of settl german there and re creat a german autonom format in the volga valley the local popul s unwelcom attitud toward migrant will intensifi as the shortag of foodstuff hous and so on worsen thi can alreadi be seen at present respond of the all russia poll were ask what will be your attitud if refuge which may appear in your region are alloc hous out of turn are given job and are help with money from the state budget the answer were as follow 1 attitud toward help with employm nt posit 58 percent neg 15 percent difficult to answer 27 percent 2 attitud toward help with money posit 56 percent neg 19 percent difficult to answer 25 percent 3 attitud toward help with hous posit 29 percent neg 33 percent difficult to answer 38 percent the acut of the hous problem in russia where the number of peopl wait for hous is in excess of 9 million wa clearli manifest by the fact that less than one third of those poll are inclin to support the polici of prioriti hous alloc for forc migrant thi indic of potenti conflict rise sharpli when the ethnic composit of migrant doe not coincid with the titular ethnic group at their new place of settlement in other word mass migrat is fraught with a chain reaction of interethn conflict the symptom of which can alreadi be seen specif they take the form of grow nation and attempt to initi pogrom against peopl of differ nation or religion in oblast which have taken in larg number of migrant there are differ forecast about the migrat of russian to russia the number of potenti migrant could includ virtual all 25 million russian live in nearbi foreign countri some 4 5 million peopl in the next 5 10 year thi is the maximum size of the migrat flow which could be prompt either in the event of exacerb of interethn relat or as a result of the start of combat oper on the territori of former union republ accord to feder migrat servic data over the next 12 18 month we can expect between 650 000 and 1 2 million peopl to arriv in russia from nearbi foreign countri 300 000 400 000 from ukrain and belaru 250 000 550 000 from central asia and kazakhstan 40 000 100 000 from the transcaucasu and 25 000 45 000 from the baltic countri the mass migrat of russian from ukrain and belaru to russia and of ukrainian and belarusian to ukrain and belaru can happen onli in the event of militari conflict between the republ although in ukrain for exampl there are even now forc prepar to instig thi process the situat with russian is even more complex in kazakhstan where there are about 6 million of them one fourth of all russian live in former union republ outsid the russian feder there is a larg flow of russian migrant from kazakhstan thi trend is grow it is possibl to forecast three avenu and consequ three period of the migrat of russian to russia an activ migrat of first and second gener russian is expect from turkmenistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan azerbaijan uzbekistan and kazakhstan between 30 and 50 percent of the russian speak popul intend to emigr from there some 18 20 percent of russian intend to leav latvia estonia lithuania moldova georgia and armenia up to 11 percent of russian express desir to leav ukrain and belaru accord to poll result about 2 million russian intend to move to russia today becaus they feel persecut along nation and linguist line both now and in the futur the forc migrant from union republ are mainli engin technician skill industri worker teacher and physician in other word strictli urban peopl who will be unabl to settl in the larg citi becaus of resid permit problem they cannot buy or build hous in town becaus the law forbid it thi is whi mani of them perceiv their situat as hopeless there is hardli ani need to comment on the polit view of present and futur migrant or their attitud toward the new polit and econom realiti which have turn them into outcast there are six special and transit recept point for refuge open and function on russia s territori there is discuss of the possibl of set up similar point and region migrat servic in everi oblast the committe for migrat affair proce from the premis that thi is not onli a calam but also to a certain extent a benefit for russia the govern is begin to realiz that the recept and settlement of migrant will requir larg invest but those return to their histor motherland are almost the most enterpris skill and industri part of the nation a public committe for the settlement of forc migrant is function in just under one year it ha process about 1 million person and ha help 20 000 but the work on migrat problem is fragment there is no coordin at state level and resourc are be wast mani categori of migrant have found themselv altogeth outsid the sphere of state regul it is clear that the feder migrat servic will not be abl to cope with the swell flood of migrant on it own the situat call for immedi action there is need for a packag of interlink measur and coordin action by state migrat organ the foreign ministri the committe for emerg situat the state committe for nation affair and the public organ in other word there is need for a nationwid feder program for help to our compatriot furthermor thi program must be given top prioriti from the materi financi and the polit diplomat point of view alik the state s polici toward migrat need more than just seriou amend bear in mind the provision qualit and quantit apprais of migrat and it sociopolit consequ we are talk about actual elabor a new all embrac and effect migrat polici it main action and principl would appear to be the follow help for forc migrant must includ not onli the provis of compens land credit and employ inform but also the lift of all restrict on resid permit and the choic of place of resid migrant togeth with all other russian must be given equal right to buy and sell at russia s hous and labor market and not be made hostag of suprem state interest the swell or subsid of migrat process will depend at the veri least on polit decis by the leadership of variou republ about protect the right of ethnic minor and the pace at which the indigen of the republ popul proce there must be no delay in elabor more precis guidelin in mutual relat between former ussr republ and compon of the russian feder it is obviou without ani addit research that today we need to conclud between the sovereign state former ussr republci a treati on the right of ethnic minor to work educ and cultur and nation autonomi to do some addit work on the feder treati between compon of the russian feder it is necessari to defin and uncondit ensur econom social and polit guarante for refuge victim of interethn conflict and forc migrant regardless of their nation religion ideolog belief or the region

ethnic problem and interest of differ peopl in econom social and cultur polici to constitut defin the divers nation movement reflect the interest of variou ethnic group includ those without their own

migrant in individu region of the countri like for exampl stavropol and krasnodar kray and some other to promot an improv of the psycholog climat surround migrant and to defin sanction against organ of power and citizen fan enmiti between the local popul and migrant to make much better use of the profession potenti of worker and engin from among forc migrant and refuge to organ the retrain of migrant with a view to reduc the armi of forc unemploy to encourag entrepreneuri activ by migrant temporari benefit in the taxat of small busi to form special budget and extrabudget fund for the effect resolut of these and other emerg problem the republ parliament must revisit the problem of the russian languag s statu it must be given the statu of state languag wherev it is use by the major of the popul thi approach is in line with intern norm and would obvious promot the further harmon of interst relat there also is a press need to conclud interst agreement on human right with all former union republ monitor of their fulfil could be carri out at both state and public level the statu of econom relat with variou state must depend on the observ of these intern agreement and the principl of intern law it is expedi to support the creation of trade and econom center in moscow and russia for russian commun abroad to assist russian in enrol in higher and special educ establish and to sponsor and support russian school and the russian languag and cultur all peopl of russia are fratern for the russian peopl our peopl desir to live in peac and friendship with the peopl of all other countri our concern about the fate of russian peopl is not aim against other peopl and state russia s path lead through peac solut of problem and mutual cooper to univers and just peac h6 5 problem of russia s econom mutual relat with ci countri h6 the rate of the slump in product and inflat continu to grow in ci countri in 1993 the govern of not a singl ci republ succeed in halt the process of econom declin on the whole the total volum of industri product in the commun wa reduc by 20 percent in compar price over the year the share slump wa not affect to ani larg degre by the differ natur and pace of econom reform in differ countri in the condit of transpar border and unifi money circul within the rubl zone the lack of coordin in econom activ hurt the financ of neighbor the imbal in reciproc deliveri ha alreadi evolv into an imbal in the intern settlement of ci countri on the whole it is possibl to agre with the opinion of world bank associ k mikhalopoulo and d tarr the situat as regard trade and payment in the former soviet republ wa distinguish by chao which reflect the exist of a seri of problem the disorgan of the credit monetari and payment system wa at the heart of these problem the main problem is that the reduct of interrepubl trade will promot the further declin of the volum of output and incom therefor polit strategist will have to creat mechan for the transit period which would help the new state to restor the effect flow of trade and avoid further seriou breach of thi flow in the short term support in the longer term the restructur of their economi and it integr in the world economi after all the sharpli increas depend of each ci state on the extern market becom a condit for the function of their economi as a matter of fact these realiti are onli just be realiz and taken into account in the econom practic of ci countri on the whole as 1993 ha shown the step up of the economi extern depend will continu thi depend will be most graphic demonstr in the sphere of satisfi the ci countri energi need sovereign ha undermin russia s potenti as energi supplier let us add for object s sake that cutback in the rate of oil extract start four year ago accord to estim by russia s ministri of fuel and energi oil extract drop by a further 50 million tonn in 1993 in other word will reach onli 340 million tonn if thi pace of reduc the extract of black gold is maintain then in the veri near futur the fuel and energi complex will be work to meet onli russia s own need which today stand at 240 million tonn oil export increas more than threefold but thi increas wa accompani by a reduct of deliveri to ci countri by an averag of 50 percent in thi context russia could be suspect of wage a cold war against ukrain and the baltic and central asian countri but such an approach would be base on inertia of thought fact prove whether it is advantag for russia to deliv oil product to the former republ russia deliv it output primarili raw materi which are competit on the world market to nearbi foreign countri at price equival on averag to 30 40 percent of world price and acquir from nearbi foreign countri output at price equival to about 70 percent of world price moreov in mani instanc russia often fail to receiv ani payment at all for it export for exampl have deliv to nearbi foreign countri about 50 million tonn of oil to a total valu of 6 5 billion by way of payment it receiv machineri and equip worth onli 700 million but russia s extern econom depend wa also increas and ha almost trebl have reach 14 15 percent of gnp thi is more than in india and japan let alon the unit state extern depend demand addit foreign currenc resourc for the economi s function natur some of the sourc are ga oil and oil product come back to the idea of cold war against ukrain it is appropri to recal one contenti problem last year ukrain sold abroad at world price of cours 8 million tonn out of the 33 5 million tonn of oil it had receiv from russia accord to some estim the amount earn from thi deal is equal to for exampl the cost of build a major intern airport at say novosibirsk capabl of earn an annual profit to the tune of 700 800 million russia s economi today bear the heavi burden of addit export and import expenditur associ with transit charg for cross the territori of neighbor state but the safeti of good in transit is not guarante not even by ukrain of cours the press cite numer fact about russia s debt to other ci republ but the overal balanc is thi russia had a posit balanc of about r750 billion similar trend will also persist next year even though the govern ha taken a seri of measur to put an end to nonpay apprais the situat in russia s econom tie with nearbi foreign countri it can be said that 1993 saw the start of sober up from euphoria in the ci it is of cours prematur to conclud that the balanc of centrifug and centripet forc show that the latter are stronger but thi awaken coupl with disappoint and lost illus ha also brought in a certain proport of common sens h3 section v v the creation of favor intern condit for the implement of reform in russia h3 h6 1 exist realiti h6 in order to elabor russia s strategi in the sphere of nation and intern secur it is necessari to analyz the posit it occupi in the world and the essenc of it intern interest as determin by the profound chang of the last few year there are four main factor make up the system of russia s polici guidelin at least for the 1990 s the first is the fact that the soviet union ha disintegr thu put an end to the world s bipolar structur there ha been a radic chang in the geopolit role play by russia which ha becom a compon of the world commun russia ha inherit from the ussr 75 percent of it territori 51 percent of it popul 60 percent of fix product asset in term of valu and 76 percent of enterpris produc mean of product it account for 90 percent of oil extract 73 percent of ga extract 63 percent of electr gener 80 percent of crude oil export and almost 100 percent of natur ga export it procuc more than one half of the gnp produc in the ussr in 1990 but russia is not just smaller than the ussr in size it ha found itself in a fundament new environ to the west and to the south where the former soviet republ lie furthermor some of them have been profoundli hit by domest instabl they are extrem suscept to extern influenc and are in conflict with one anoth the paradox is that formal these are foreign countri as far as russia is concern in fact howev they remain insepar link with it both by their common histor past and by the multitud of live econom cultur social and psycholog bond the second factor russia is experienc a most profound econom and sociopolit crisi whose solut still lie far into the futur at the same time by dint of it size and of the polit and strateg legaci inherit from the ussr russia remain one of the world s lead countri it will not be at all simpl for russia to find it place in the intern arena russia s new leadership bear the burden of a difficult twin task to creat a new system of foreign and domest polici ture it into a catalyst of radic market reform and at the same time to overcom the burden of problem inherit from the past the third factor the russian feder as a genuin democrat republ russia no longer ha a plan economi but it still ha not acquir a market economi the unitari state ha collaps but the best possibl balanc between central and local power ha yet to be found furthermor the feder today face the threat of disun and fragment into separ princip final the fourth factor is associ with chang in the surround world we are wit the onset of a more tradit but also a much more complex time of multilater diplomaci intricaci of contradict and coincid of state interest shift coalit and limit polit goal the threat of a univers war is declin but there is a grow danger of local conflict fraught with escal of combat oper in variou region all thi indic that the mainten of peac in the futur will requir activ work by intern and region organ to ensur collect secur as well as joint peacemak action by the power proceed from what ha been said abov what are our fatherland s main foreign polici prioriti at present russia ha three interlink suprem foreign polici prioriti the first is to ensur polit stabil in the countri prevent war and settl arm conflict on the territori of the former ussr both within and between individu republ primarili by polit mean the second is to prevent the emerg of hegemon power in europ south asia and the far east which would strive to extend their influenc to region in the former ussr where the situat is unstabl the third is to preserv the statu of a great power occupi a special posit in the world s geostrateg structur the main point for russia is to ensur polit stabil and to prevent and settl conflict across the former ussr should instabl and potenti conflict there grow further thi would threaten both russia s territori integr and it econom and democrat reform the maximum desir task is econom and polit integr on the basi of equal right voluntari and mutual advantag for ci countri primarili russia ukrain kazakhstan and belaru if the desir prove unattain then the vital import minimum task for the russian feder is to prevent the creation of a hostil coalit russia is proceed from the premis that the helsinki principl of the inviol of border must provid the foundat of mutual relat between the former ussr republ ani revis of border would be permiss onli via peac talk sanction includ the use of forc would be permiss onli in the event that a countri s leadership pursu a polici of genocid toward ethnic minor and thi is recogn and defin as genocid under un rule germani turkey japan china and other are potenti capabl of pose the threat of region hegemoni to russia in the 1990 s of cours nobodi is accus the aforement countri of current act along thi avenu but a sober forecast of the shift balanc of forc and of the geopolit situat make it mandatori to consid the possibl of chang in their polici which are not even contempl at present the unit state is russia s most import partner in counter region hegemoni the remain center of power are still not capabl of realli influenc the situat in hot spot be they in the near east angola or yugoslavia the caucasu or afghanistan russia is plan to pursu thi prioriti use differ method in differ region in europ for exampl the guarante for prevent ani militari polit expansion by lead state is perceiv in the develop of european integr and the stregnthen of the csce as an organ of collect secur and collect respons to ani potenti aggressor in the past the ussr use to advoc the simultan disband of nato and the warsaw pact organ wpo not onli ha the nato bloc not been disband but is is actual build up it might thi organ cannot be smoothli transform into a european secur structur we believ that a stabil of the situat in the russian feder on the basi of market economi and the develop of democraci will creat the need for a fundament new intern organ possibl on the basi of util and develop element from the structur of the ec the west european union nato and the csce and with particip by russia the unit state and canada the russian feder s polici in asia minor malaya aziya and south asia could take the form of direct includ militari resist to outsid interfer by agreement with the republ under threat the natur of the multipolar world adjoin the transcaucasu is much more complex russia s partner here is object iran and turkey in south asia the mainten of a certain balanc between them is in line with russia s interest despit the fact that the west would obvious give prefer to turkey as a member of nato the mainten of the u s militari presenc in japan is in line with russia s interest in the far east in the event of withdraw by the unit state and of china s headlong econom and militari strengthen japan s reaction could onli take the form of acceler remilitar a clash between the two huge power over korea taiwan hong kong or southeast asia could also involv russia in the conflict ani sharp chang of the balanc of forc in favor of china or japan and the emerg of hegemon aspir in one of the two power could pose a direct threat to russia s far east it is obviou that russia need to retain it posit as a great world power thi mean russia s particip in the un secur council as one of it perman member and it role in other intern structur it also mean particip as far as possibl in the mainten of peac and the repuls of aggress includ along the line of peacemak forc within the framework of the secur council the csce and other and genocid termin oper sanction by the unit nation and region intern organ russia advoc

trade as a whole the problem of russia s militari strateg pariti with the unit state deserv special mention it will be necessari to continu the mutual balanc reduct of russian feder and u s strateg nuclear forc on new term here we need a transit from mutual deterr through the abil to deliv a crush counterstrik on the aggressor to joint manag of strateg stabil thi is whi talk will constitut the sphere of special mutual relat and mutual interest between russia and the unit state h6 2 nation interest h6 let us examin russia s specif nation interest from the viewpoint of intern secur retain the great power statu thi is russia s natur right vest in it thank to it econom potenti the success it ha achiev in scienc cultur militari might and so on guarante eurasian stabil whenev the eurasian balanc of forc ha been disrupt russia ha tradit been the main victim therefor the desir by ani one state or coalit of state to domin eurasia will not be in russia s fundament nation interest nor can our interest be serv by attempt to isol russia squeez it out of the black sea and the baltic sea reduc foreign econom commod turnov chang it structur and so on ensur polit and econom stabil in state all along russia s border thi is a key interest for ani power but the problem of prevent the emerg of conflict zone along the border is especi import for russia which ha the world s longest land border and with it complex relat with neighbor which are root in the past parri and prevent potenti threat the world in which we are live now is a world of power partnership and power rivalri within the framework of rigid durabl structur despit the chang which have occur in the last few year especi the end of the cold war the improv of relat between the unit state and russia the rapproch to a certain extent between east and west europ and so on more sophist principl of power balanc and power collabor still remain the foundat of contemporari intern relat indic like econom scientif and intellectu potenti play a greater role in the system of state might but the militari compon still domin the structur of interst power real militari nuclear missil confront on a global level remain onli between russia and the unit state for the time be the continu of nuclear confront between our countri is object and inevit in the forese futur furthermor the grow nuclear missil potenti of the prc and west europ also pose a militari threat for russia in the 1990 s final russia s cultur secur and it origin are threaten by the west s liber individualist ideolog to the exent that collectiv still domin awar and think and today s russian realiti at the region level it is necessari to proceed from the fact that in the event of exacerb of the domest crisi virtual all of russia s neighbor could potenti rais sundri territori claim although the econom cultur and other categori of secur are not obvious link with militari secur mani arm conflict have start with mistak commit in nonmilitari sphere therefor the prevent of threat to russia must be activ wage across the entir spectrum thi is russia s main nation interest h6 3 foreign polici h6 we deem it import to singl out the follow basic object and guidelin for defin the strategi of russia s develop and behavior in the world commun of peopl the russian feder is constantli present in the arena of world polit life it is a differ matter that russia s domest situat and it geopolit environ at present do not favor the pursuit of an activ global polici and it region interest will call for the greatest of effort in the next few year the possess of a mighti nuclear potenti doe not chang the situat either for the first time in mani year our countri is in a situat wherebi it doe not face ani definit or in ani way signific extern militari threat territori disput involv countri which will certainli not resort to militari forc for their solut provid of cours russia remain a unit state all thi is except advantag for concentr the countri s effort on the solut of the domest task concern radic transform and the problem constantli emerg in mutual relat with ci countri relat with germani at least over the last two centuri have occupi a central posit among the prioriti of russia s foreign polici but the experi of the 20th centuri with it two world war the cruel battl without preced in histori and the huge sacrific and destruct suffer by both side would seem to indic the irreconcil of the two countri interest true enough the period between the two war produc a whole rang of mutual advantag econom and even militari technic cooper that wa the period when the averag german realiz that the situat in germani develop well whenev it relat with russia are good russia need a new east asian and pacif polici it backbon must be provid by relat with china as it main partner not onli in the region but also in the broader global context the posit potenti in the histori of russian chines relat is much more power than the

alik in the direct of a unifi approach toward maintain the immut of world war ii s result in the far east both countri are reliabl partner in the caus of uncondit observ the yalta confer decis on the far east in other word confirm outer mongolia s statu and the fact that the kuril island and south sakhalin belong to russia it is possibl to defin the follow long term interest of the secur of the russian feder preserv gener stabil in the world capabl of resist local arm conflict elimin the seat of tension close to the russian feder s territori and fraught with the explos of arm conflict maintain normal relat with all state primarili with european and asian state and elev these relat to the level of partnership strengthen and develop the peacemak potenti of the unit nation the csce and other with a view to the earliest possibl polit settlement of conflict threaten to evolv into arm clash the further deepen of the process of disarma offer an opportun to reduc the russian arm forc to the minimum level necessari to ensur extern secur and honor the russian feder s intern commit restor the russian feder s intern prestig as the legitim heir of the former soviet union and a great power recogn by the world commun the fewer the forc be divert extern the faster will the establish of russian statehood proceed in the condit of the world s deepen interdepend thi can happen if the intern situat remain stabl for a number of year on end without arm conflict capabl of shake thi stabil at the same time it is imposs to rule out the probabl of local conflict flare in region where there are confront along religi nationalist or other line unfortun these region lie along the former soviet union s southwestern and southern border it is in russia s interest to elimin ani local conflict develop in the world by polit mean and as swiftli as possibl thi is whi the russian feder must support by all possibl mean the polit peacemak potenti of the unit nation the csce and other intern organ it is in our interest to follow jointli with the other power the path of deeper reduct of armament and arm forc guid by the principl of suffici for defens sensibl reduct of russia s arm forc and armament will not onli eas the econom burden but will also make it possibl to util the high technolog potenti of defens enterpris for the russian economi s recoveri when determin the size of

of the commun of interest in ensur collect defens will be an import factor of the develop of centripet forc the next two to four year will be especi import for the russian feder s futur it will be virtual imposs to resolv the task of econom reviv without elimin conflict and their potenti sourc proceed from thi premis it is possibl to defin the follow short term interest of the russian feder s secur termin interethn conflict in region adjoin the russian feder s caucasian border reach accord on an econom area within the framework of the former soviet union and the appropri border regim between state implement the accord concern the state border secur regim along the entir perimet of the former soviet union reach accord between the russian feder and other ci state on question of protect against nuclear attack and of strengthen the intern regim for the nonprolifer of nuclear weapon the sober up which is occur in ci state in the econom sphere and the grow awar of the consequ of the breakdown of econom tie indic that thi avenu could success serv the solut of the task of ensur russia s gener safeti and secur it is obviou that in order to organ a singl econom area it will becom necessari to solv the question of border regim both between ci state and along the former soviet union s perimet unless thi is done it will be imposs to avoid econom sabotag close the extern border otherwis the russian feder s border will also be penetr halt the rise of crime and especi of organ crime and so on the most vulner sector of the russian feder s border lie in the region of interethn conflict it is therefor in our nation interest to extinguish all interethn conflict along the caucasian border and achiev the restor of peac and tranquil there in today s condit it is imposs to ensur the secur of border between ci countri without help from the arm forc from the polit viewpoint it would be disadvantag for russia to becom the first to introduc arm protect of border with ci countri it would therefor be expedi to begin with a gener accord on border regim what will be the natur of border the extent to which arm forc will particip in their protect and so on it would be expedi if the new state were to use their own forc to protect their border thi appli especi to the southern border thi section of the border ha been close in russia s interest but it is unfair for russia alon to bear the respons and cost it is in the ci state nation interest to receiv guarante against nuclear attack the likelihood of which ha to be taken into consider in today s world the russian feder is in a posit to back up such guarante at the same time howev we are interest in have all ci state join the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon the nuclear power today are interest in strengthen the regim of nonprolifer of nuclear weapon and rule out ani access to them for adventurist and irrespons politician furthermor joint action by all nuclear power in thi sphere promot the develop of relat of trust between them which is also in line with the russian feder s interest h6 4 threat to the preserv of state stabil and secur measur for their neutral h6 the idea of superpow statu base upon unrestrain militar wa the primari caus of the soviet union s defeat in the cold war and it subsequ collaps the russian feder s return to such a polici would pose the greatest threat to it statehood and secur as for the extern threat it natur ha chang wherea previous the arm threat origin primarili from the west there is no worri origin from thi direct at present at the same time it would be prematur to rule out militari danger from the southwest in the event of ani protract of the arm conflict in yugoslavia capabl of involv neighbor countri the conflict s religi aspect is especi danger becaus we are talk about three faith with adher in mani countri includ the russian feder romania could also produc a seat of tension or rather an outburst of romanian great power chauvin which ha not abandon the idea of re creat a greater romania incorpor moldova and the dniester region land should thi happen ani such action by romania will inevit prompt reaction in bulgaria the dobruja question in hungari transylvania and even in russia the dniester republ a danger seat of militari threat could develop in the region adjoin the caucasian and central asian ci state islam fundament compris mighti forc and in today s situat it nurtur the hope of creat a bloc of islam state under the auspic of pakistan iran and less like turkey such a bloc will inevit tri to includ in it orbit azerbaijan turkmenistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan it cannot be rule out that it might attempt to influenc kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan as well when evalu thi danger it is necessari to take into account the chang natur of mutual relat within the triangl of the russian feder the arab countri and israel the normal of the russian feder s relat with israel and the latter s susten through emigr from russia coupl with the fact that the russian feder ha to a certain extent distanc itself from libya and iraq are provid ground for grow anti russian feel in the arab countri final it would be a mistak to complet rule out the possibl of militari pressur from the southeast or from china should thi happen demograph pressur will not be the onli factor in oper elabor of nation consensu on foreign polici question it is an axiom that a state is strong through the uniti of it citizen posit state have overcom the difficulti face them most easili when there ha been a commun of view among their citizen it is import

the past for ideolog reason continu of the cours of achiev accord on disarma question the widespread differ of opinion on whether the cours of achiev accord on further reduct of arm forc and armament is advantag for russia are to a certain extent harm to the elabor of nation consensu on foreign polici question the time ha come to abandon propaganda declar like the complet ban and withdraw of nuclear weapon and to take a realist point of view a certain quantiti of nuclear potenti is a guarante of secur both for the russian feder and the ci state in addit it is necessari to aim both now and in the forese futur for a ration regul of the balanc of the nuclear missil potenti of russia the unit state britain franc and china which remain the stabil foundat of the contemporari world order thi regul ought to be implement through deep cut of nuclear arm the strengthen of the regim of nonprolifer of mass destruct weapon and missil technolog and the creation of a global system for the world commun s protect against nuclear missil attack as propos by us the switch to thi point of view will facilit talk with the other nuclear power includ talk on the most ration level of nuclear deterr it is also import to emphas that we are hope for understand of our desir for real nuclear disarma by ukrain kazakhstan and belaru we are count on their join as soon as possibl the treati on the

militari strength will without ani doubt continu to serv as an ultim mean of deterr against extern threat and of ensur our nation secur take into account the object reduct of the role play by militari strength as the main instrument for protect russia s nation interest the foremost task now is to creat a system of collect respons by ci state and by state former ussr republ which have not join the

intern commun to give russia s peacemak forc a mandat to oper in the region s conflict zone under un auspic and with the statu of blue helmet one of russia s most import foreign polici object is it particip in the strengthen of eurasian secur russia cannot accept the tendenc toward nato s expans via the admiss of east european countri to the bloc thi approach is akin to the build of a new movabl

accumul by the csce must be extend to other region in the world on the basi of russian interest primarili to the asia pacif region by galvan it foreign polici in the asia pacif region russia could initi the launch of a process similar to the csce in thi region and the hold of a summit confer follow the helsinki model one of the stage of thi process could be the conven on russia s initi of the

the conclus of an intern convent on liabil for damag dome to the environ as a result of the nuclear arm race could be an effect measur for the mainten of intern ecolog secur two main trend domin the west s polici at present a to use all possibl mean to push russia into copi the western primarili the u s model regardless of ani consequ for the countri and the popul b to prevent russia from take full advantag of the west s modern technolog achiev and drive it mainli toward the product of raw materi fuel and semimanufactur in other word to sink the countri in backward in the third world mani peopl believ that ani expect that the west and the unit state will help the reviv of a mighti and independ russia are at best naiv the west is increasingli lose it interest in us becaus first we have lost our former econom and militari strength and second we are no longer claim to be creat a social altern to the west at the same time as can be seen from b clinton s speech in the long term and by attract resourc for it modern from germani and japan and possibl from franc itali and britain russia could weaken competit between the western power in the econom sphere it is also worth note the question of reviv the bipolar system but on a complet new basi the idea of form a second pole is certainli not the product of abstract imagin or a specul project the shortcom and danger of the monopolar system make it necessari to consid the altern idea of a second pole the u s monopoli as the sole world leader could tragic destabil intern relat by it veri natur the bipolar system offer a more stabl basi for cooper between the center of world polit it will enabl the third world countri china and russia to protect their common and individu interest in a more or less organ way and consequ to guarante the greater effect of their effort the creation of a second pole could also strengthen militari polit stabil in the countri adjoin it and could becom an instrument for settl conflict without the west s interfer a seriou motiv for thi could be provid by the need to protect nation cultur asset to counter the expans of western mass cultur and at the same time to pool effort for the shape of competit nation cultur on the basi of the peopl own vital valu and the renew of their tradit equal collabor between all cultur could serv as a counterweight to the hegemoni of western mass cultur which is be implant final a substanti justif for form a second pole is provid by the quest for a new type of civil to replac the domin industri capitalist one whose exhaust and crisi are increasingli obviou and univers recogn thi object could attract sympathi for the second pole among mani progress stream in the west which are concern with the quest for a new way of life collabor between the two center would most probabl lead to posit chang in the natur and content of the first pole s activ and give it a more realist orient even the actual discuss of the problem of creat a second pole could lead to favor albeit partial posit chang in our opinion bipolar will acceler the process of form a global system on the basi of the balanc of interest and becom a step in that direct all of mankind includ the atlant center is interest in creat the second pole becaus it offer a program for extric from the crisi be experienc by the whole world although the second pole is need partli as a counterweight to the first their relat need not be antagonist but could be built on the principl of cooper includ cooper between the unit state and russia a return to the bipolar model of the world is not the onli possibl option the multipolar system also ha it advantag in ani case it is import to ensur that thi system guarante stabil and russia occupi in it a posit befit the statu of a great power h6 5 disarma problem h6 russia did not inherit ani militari polit alli from the ussr it is object unabl to maintain the mighti arm forc which the soviet union had in mani direct the paramet of russia s defens were move far beyond the limit of it state border now the countri either ha no such paramet or they have end up be unusu close to it central region the end of the great confront between the two superpow did not lead to the triumph of the principl of nonus of forc in intern affair as proclaim by the unit nation or to the disband of militari polit allianc creat or so the explan went to parri the soviet militari threat moreov the sole remain superpow display a notic stronger desir to impos it will wherev it feel that u s interest exist includ the baltic countri there is no need to explain that if russia intend to solv it own problem guid by it own nation interest it must be strong in everi respect includ by no mean least in defens question we have the full potenti to do so thi doe not run counter to the long term peacemak guidelin proclaim by russia s presid in hi januari 1992 messag to the un secretari gener the principl of effect global and region militari polit stabil declar in thi messag also presuppos measur for mutual disarma thi is precis whi russia offici took over from the ussr the baton of reduc the militari potenti of state and eas the level of intern tension it confirm the commit under intern treati and agreement to which the soviet side wa a parti and also sign in januari 1993 the russian u s treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start ii thu the track taken by russia in the sphere of the disarma process is in line with the one which the ussr follow dure the last year of it exist but the differ militari strateg condit in which russia now find itself demand of it the elabor of new concept and approach toward the solut of problem concern the arm limit and reduct h5 nuclear disarma problem h5 the salt i and salt ii soviet u s agreement in the strateg arm limit sphere were underpin by the principl of equal and ident secur which wa agre by the side it main criterion wa the ensur of militari strateg equilibrium thi in the side opinion not onli coincid with the secur interest of the partner in the talk but also promot the stabil of the world situat but the last soviet u s treati on the reduct and limit of strateg offens arm start i contain provis make it possibl to bypass thi principl if necessari the treati s shortcom includ not onli the univers known notion count of weapon which total negat the side initi proclaim intent to reduc their strateg potenti by one half but also a seri of provis place the side in unequ condit for exampl the treati impos stricter limit on land base icbm s which have tradit been the foundat of the ussr s and now of russia s strateg might at the same time the most liber interpret ha been appli to reduct requir for heavi bomber in which the unit state enjoy a threefold advantag there is absolut no justif for exclud from the treati s effect the strateg sea launch cruis missil which are object more advantag for the unit state the soviet side simpli fail to obtain agreement from it partner at the talk that the abm treati should be observ while the start i treati is in forc consequ the unit state retain the possibl to chang the strateg potenti to it advantag by implement the sdi program the start i treati ha still not come into forc despit thi a new now russian u s treati on the further reduct and limit of strateg offens weapon start ii wa sign in januari 1993 follow compar brief talk but thi treay is not flawless suffic it to mention it provis on the procedur for the convers of icbm s and submarin launch ballist missil from multipl warhead to singl warhead and the reorient of 100 u s heavi bomber for the perform of nonnuclear task the start ii treati s provis potenti offer the u s side an opportun to re instal more than 4 500 nuclear warhead on strateg deliveri platform within the briefest of time frame bear in mind that the total number of nuclear warhead the side may hold after the reduct should not exceed 3 000 3 500 unit russia run the risk of find itself in a situat wherebi the unit state have for some reason denounc the start ii treati could veri quickli doubl it strateg nuclear potenti under the term of the treati russia should it wish to do the same would not be abl to boost it potenti by more than 900 unit the same way nonetheless russia ha ratifi the start i treati and ha express redi to ratifi the start ii treati with all their shortcom and posit aspect at the same time it is perfectli clear that the process of the limit and reduct of strateg arm will be continu at some stage it will be join by other nuclear power on what basi should these talk be conduct what should be their ultim goal the question of complet elimin of nuclear weapon will hardli be rais in the forese futur the other nuclear power are not rais thi task even as an idea the agenda will evid includ the question of arriv at some maximum level for strateg nuclear arm to correspond with the so call minimum nuclear deterr back in the past the ussr express readi to support thi idea and to discuss and agre it strateg mean and basic criteria it might possibl be use to repeat thi attempt nevertheless regardless of whether thi concept will be discuss on a multilater or bilater with the unit state basi russia will have to determin what in it militari strateg posit should be meant by minimum nuclear deterr and thi should be the subsequ guid principl when elabor posit for talk on strateg nuclear arm and on nuclear arm in gener thi will help prevent ani reduct of russian nuclear forc below a certain critic limit it would not go amiss to also apprais the extent to which thi criterion correspond with the start i and start ii treati when accpt the concept of minimum nuclear deterr at the talk it is necessari to bear in mind that thi decis will inevit necessit the examin either in parallel or jointli with strateg nuclear arm of the question of tactic nuclear arm especi if they are deploy so as to reach target on the other side s territori includ ship base weapon as well as the uncondit observ of the abm treati h5 limit of convent arm forc and their armament h5 the consist process of disarma must certainli becom the normal polici of ani peacelov state in the post confront period furthermor the outbreak of interethn and other region conflict testifi that the reduct of the potenti of convent arm forc and armament is a task as import as that of reduc strateg and tactic nuclear potenti the continu of talk on convent arm forc and armament is especi topic for russia it is necessari not onli becaus it is becom increasingli difficult to man and maintain such larg arm forc but also becaus we will have to honor committ under the 1990 treati on convent arm forc in europ the parti to which wa the soviet union and not russia thi is not the same thing therefor strictli speak follow the disappear from the militari polit arena of one of the collect parti to the treati the wpo and later on of the ussr new talk ought to be held on the reduct of convent arm forc in europ and a new accord ought to be reach take into account the sharp chang in the situat in thi import region of the planet on 8 juli 1992 russia ratifi the treati under which it also commit itself to the stage by stage reduct of the numer strength of it armi and navi from 2 8 million to 2 1 million men by 1995 and to 1 5 million men by the year 2000 at the same time the nato state did not embark on ani limit and reduct of the numer strength of their arm forc and firmli refus to take naval forc one of the most import compon into account when determin the militari strateg balanc enjoy undisput superior in naval armament capabl of deliv strike against land base target carrier born aviat sea launch cruis missil nato wa unwil to lose thi imbal thi posit is most typic of the entir western approach toward talk on the limit of convent arm forc in europ it envisag the elimin of imbal but onli in those categori of armament where the wpo enjoy the advantag it is clear that ani potenti futur talk cannot leav the question of naval armament outsid the scope of agreement especi as regard armament design to strike against land base target the veri fact of the accept of commit under an accord elabor for anoth state the ussr and for differ militari strateg condit realli goe beyond the framework of ordinari common sens which indic that russia ought to accept and honor onli commit which have been thoroughli and specif elabor for the russian condit otherwis the situat may reach the point of absurd as it did in 1993 dure the withdraw of troop from germani and the attempt to deploy them in the north caucasu militari district it emerg that russia could not do thi without breach sever provis of the treati it had ratifi it also emerg that russia cannot show ani concern for it southern flank as it see fit sinc it is constrain by limit under thi treati much ha been and is be said about the principl of suffici there is hardli a singl state in the world which would declar that the militari organiz develop of it arm forc is guid by the principl of insuffici or supersuffici therefor the term of simpl suffici is meaningless the term defens suffici or suffici for defens would be more appropri to the concept of russia s defens polici but the mean of even thi term demand thorough elabor onli when thi term ha been given specif content in line with the russian state s militari doctrin it can and must provid the basi of posit for subsequ talk on arm limit h6 6 the need to improv the mechan for manag militari organiz develop h6 ani polit program of the leadership need a finetun mechan for their implement otherwis they will remain noth but wish think in the sphere of militari work we are still nurtur the illus that we are talk onli of a partial reduct of the arm forc and a partial switch of the militari economi to the manufactur of nation econom output and that the actual mechan for manag militari organiz develop can remain basic the same fundament document in the defens sphere are be implement with difficulti there is no doubt that the basic provis of the militari doctrin will creat the necessari prerequisit for the organiz develop of de facto new arm forc for russia for the reliabl protect of it interest for the elabor of long term militari technic polici for the creation and further develop of qualit new forc and for the train and educ of the personnel the militari doctrin approv by the presid basic ensur that russia will honor it intern commit on the reduct of armament and arm forc and the mainten of peac the specif applic of the militari doctrin in the sphere of the militari economi is defin in the presid s special edict no 1850 of 11 novemb 1992 wherea onli certain clarifi remark can be made as regard the doctrin s militari and militari technic aspect there are doubt aris as regard the econom mechan thi is becaus attempt are be made to retain the old method of manag and adapt them to the complet differ socioeconom condit now develop in russia under the former administr edict system of manag when all element of the econom organ were not onli subordin to the state but also belong to it the main mechan of manag were program and plan five year annual and so on the plan ratif wa follow by the implement of the principl that the plan is law and must be fulfil at all cost at time it wa wreck more often than not it wa fulfil but the mechan function now the situat ha chang radic complet differ law oper in the market economi even the law on defens adopt in 1992 enshrin that the state order in other word the plan issu from abov call for mandatori fulfil onli in wartim financi and econom incent should be use in peacetim the budget and the taxat system becom the main instrument of manag it is therefor anachronist for the militari doctrin in it section on militari technic and econom foundat to reli on elabor and implement of long term up to 10 15 year program for armament and militari equip on the basi of state defens order financ by the state attent must mainli be given to a comprehens substanti and balanc defens budget it is the budget that bring togeth the contradictori interest of variou depart involv in the solut of task concern the countri s defens suffic it to recal the august septemb 1993 outburst of passion surround the budget at the highest level in russia thi is whi the budget need independ expert apprais it will help the practic implement of the doctrin s militari polit provis and it is through the budget that civilian control will be exercis over the activ of the power depart thi is whi repres of variou nonstat institut advoc a public discuss of the defens budget comprehens control and prompt account for it fuilfil the basic provis of the militari doctrin also contain other weak point which prompt critic by the opposit inde a seri of provis need clarif and amend to the extent that life and russia s militari strateg situat will chang h5 challeng and potenti h5 histori s main lesson is that we won world war ii but lost the leadership race which is run accord to econom rule have lost it superpow statu russia slid headlong to the rank of develop countri and now even of regress countri for the first time in the last 40 year we are not threaten by the perman danger of global militari conflict but the domest instabl the chao the devast in the economi and the mental of loser pose an equal threat to nation secur the fundament new polit realiti of which our countri s citizen are becom pain awar is that for the first time throughout it thousand year histori russia ha becom a depend countri it depend at least on foreign creditor the dollar rubl rate of exchang foreign aid and invest import deliveri and raw materi price on the world market the russian feder s foreign polici is no longer fulli autonom intern bank and agreement are larg tri to dictat even our domest polici we are virtual without alli in the world on the other hand there are fewer extern enemi too russia ha join the system of multipolar coordin of intern secur the situat is significantli wors within the area of the former ussr interethn conflict have flare along the border the former militari polit and econom allianc and institut have been destroy new one have either not been creat or are not function the nation pride of great russian ha been denigr the choic that societi and the state now have to make is not free either today we have to choos from a veri limit number of option either russia will remain a fulli depend countri or it will remain partial depend or russia will strive for full independ have decid thi crucial issu for ourselv we will be abl to choos the sole scenario for the further develop of event it appear that onli the second option is the most realist it presuppos develop base mainli on relianc on our own strength but with a high degre of extern aid but our futur freedom in decisionmak will be limit in proport with the degre of depend to paraphras w churchil s famou sentenc it can be said about russia that we no longer have ani friend we have onli partner whether we like it or not thi world is base on respect for the strength of author and the might of the state unfortun we cannot expect the former respect without have the former might consequ the most import task of russia s leadership over the next few year is to restructur the economi modern fix product asset and reduc the energi and materi intens of product the econom financi polit and militari might can be boost onli on thi basi onli a program for steadi econom growth over the next 10 15 year can ensur signific progress in the russian economi s success reform democraci is fragil all countri that have travers the long path of nurtur genuin democraci know that a young democraci unless it is legal econom and sociopolit protect is as a rule doom to degener thi is the mortal danger at present all thi is aggrav by the fact that the new structur of life we are build in russia is still far away from genuin divers the social base of reform remain narrow the shape of a genuin middl class the foundat of futur stabil took the wrong path from the veri begin the restor of our domest viabil in the sphere of product invest technolog educ and energi is the most import task for ensur both domest and extern secur stabil and independ thi is the basi on which the new nationwid ideolog should be formul the govern local administr and feder assembl deputi must realiz we are live in a chang and chang world the independ state economi can no longer remain strictli nation differ between domest and foreign polici are fade in our relat with ci state it is import to convincingli demonstr the role of destruct econom nation and cooper with them in the quest for peac way to resolv ethnic crise threaten stabil in russia europ and the world it is also necessari to be awar that have fail to organ our own effici product of competit good we are forc to import them from abroad thu creat addit job over there rather than at home and doom our own worker to unemploy and poverti the opposit also appli thi is whi the major of social problem and crise in 1994 will be associ with the economi and with domest and foreign polici the realiz of thi is alreadi halfway to solut and the adopt of correct decis is halfway to success the other half will be determin by russia s citizen their mood new incent for labor disciplin and entrepreneurship respect for the law and faith in reform hundr of correct law may be promulg the world s best constitut may be adopt but we will not extric ourselv from the system s crisi unless man feel the need to live and work better the central problem in 1994 is to restor the prestig of state power and creat an effect mechan for the law oper and for monitor the fulfil of adopt decis nation secur begin with reliabl protect of russia s citizen against ani attack and infring it is necessari to radic review the attitud toward thi question becaus the problem of human right stand right behind it whi should the assassin of one u s citizen in ani countri immedi result in inevit and effect sanction while the assassin of russian offic in georgia and tajikistan goe unpunish the state s might wa not creat in order to remain inact the experi of the latest mass oper to impos elementari order in the capit and the countri show that the popul will understand and support ani action by the author to put an end to crime thi doe not in ani way contradict the norm of democraci moreov it ought to be born in mind that the author of the russian feder s govern feder assembl and presid is larg determin by the qualiti of our idea valu and leadership and the competit of our good in the world market rather than by superior militari might we will have to solv the budget deficit problem curb inflat strengthen the regim of save and increas capit invest we also need a taxat system and a legisl system capabl of boost product rather than hinder it the lost height in the sphere of health care educ vocat train and social secur must be regain step by step follow the disintegr of the former econom tie there ha been a sharp deterior of the condit of the russian infrastructur as a whole and target invest will be requir there the follow problem will be inevit exacerb in 1994 inflat will evolv into gallop hyperinfl the rise price of energi sourc will produc a domino effect a race in price of foodstuff commod and servic there will be a further slump in product and a seri of sector will come to a halt on a nationwid scale there is a threat of social explos in the further growth of the strike movement whose particip will increasingli often and in parallel with econom demand make strictli polit demand the govern s resign the presid s impeach societi s corrupt will reach an unpreced scale the rise in crime will take mainli the path of grow number of econom crime and gangster like format demograph regress higher mortal rate reduc life expect declin birth rate pension and declass element will die off on a massiv scale unless effect chang are introduc in tax legisl the gap between the richest and the poorest strata of the popul will widen and will exceed all world indic we can expect a signific increas in the number of russian speak refuge from nearbi foreign countri to russia which will significantli complic the social atmospher in mani region the govern will have to firmli appli econom sanction against neighbor state where the right of the russian speak popul are violat new seat of interethn conflict will possibl emerg 1994 will see a higher proport of privat trade free enterpris and the privat sector of product in gener but the bank system will have to be made more flexibl and effici with a view to encourag the develop of product rather than redistribut potenti econom progress in russia in 1994 will depend larg on the restor at a qualit new level of region and intern tie partnership and cooper as nation currenc are introduc in a seri of ci countri and the singl rubl zone is be destroy it is forecast that they will be swiftli devalu against both the rubl and the dollar russia could be swamp by the flood of russian bank note be sent back thi could be wors than the size of ani emiss in term of it inflationari consequ there will be a need for emerg monetari reform and the introduct of a new rubl back by the intern russian bank fresh attempt may be made to seced from the feder and the separat of it compon may be step up russia today ha been bled almost dri and it cannot continu to act as a selfless donor for nearbi foreign countri sole on the strength of the inertia of the proletarian internation ideolog it can be forecast that there will be a tenfold increas of the number of attempt to illeg export commod and raw materi from the russian feder in 1994 the govern will inevit face the problem of build hundr of border checkpoint along russia s new state border with all former union republ includ cossack detach and settlement and a firm reject of border transpar full scale consul and embassi will have to be open and a larg number of bilater treati and decis will have to be adopt in contrast with the major of govern organ and institut we are forc to forecast someth which ha been disregard hitherto russia is approach an ecolog disast it is necessari to promptli introduc in russia tough standard of environment qualiti and sanction for their violat even includ crimin liabil russia s talent have alway been and still remain one of it categori of nation wealth the so call brain drain abroad ha reach unprecend level at present the nation scienc cultur art and literatur have been shunt to the preipheri of state interest it can be said not just about oil and ga field but also about the russian talent that by silent back thi antin polici we are sell off our grandchildren s heritag and depriv them of prospect for their intellectu and spiritu develop russia s success in the explor of space have alway been and still remain a matter of nation pride it is necessati to adopt a target program for the long term preserv of scienc intens product unit and space reasearch to encourag privat and foreign capit invest in space research and to creat new job if we miss the opportun to adopt radic decis about the futur of scienc and space research their degrad will becom irrevers and thi in it turn will slow down the growth of our countri s economi and the develop of it scientif engin and industri base thu we can imagin what russia s futur can be like we want to and
