abund and steadi the drop is huge and concentr a total of 75 12 million kw of instal capac is possibl capabl of produc 355 5 billion kwh of electr per year thi correspond respect to 20 and 19 percent of the capac and power product to be develop nation it is the most concentr water resourc in the world in the past thi lode wa not develop due to it geograph locat and region economi as our economi grow speed up the develop of the jinsha jiang hydropow base will have a major effect on allevi the sever power shortag in the southeast improv our energi structur industri structur and ecolog in the upper reach of the chang jiang and promot econom growth in southwest and southeast china in respons to a recommend made by the southern electr util corpor the china electr power associ and the china societi of hydropow engin organ a visit to the middl and lower reach of the jinsha jiang expert and top offici of differ depart from the central region and provinci govern and in the area of survey and design particip in thi effort the primari purpos of the visit wa to invit our comrad from the southeast where a sever energi shortag exist to take a first hand look at the energi resourc avail on the jinsha jiang and to explor the possibl to jointli develop thi resourc to suppli electr power from west to east h5 i jinsha jiang resourc are abund and easi to develop h5 the jinsha jiang is a branch of the upper reach of the chang jiang and flow from yushu qinghai to yibin sichuan it flow through qinghai xizang sichuan and yunnan and is 2 290 kilomet long it cover a basin of more than 490 000 km sup 2 the flow is abund and steadi and the head is huge and concentr the averag flow is 4 920 m sup 3 s and the mean annual discharg is 155 billion m sup 3 there is not much fluctuat in the annual discharg the ratio of the wettest to the driest year is mere 1 38 the main stream ha a drop of 3 280 m and the mean drop is 1 43 percent it can accommod a total instal capac of 75 12 million kw and produc 355 5 billion kwh of electr per year correspond to 20 percent of the capac to be develop nationwid and 19 percent of the electr to be gener the amount of electr power gener per year is equival to 128 million ton of standard coal it will play a pivot role in balanc our primari energi resourc it rank first in the world in term of abund and concentr of hydropow resourc the middl and lower section of the jinsha jiang from shigu to yibin is the focu of research and develop after repeat survey proof of concept and plan in the past 30 year accord to the brief on comprehens util of the chang jiang basin plan and the develop plan prepar by the kunm institut and the chengdu institut the middl and lower reach of the jinsha jiang can be develop in 10 stage figur 1 is a schemat

51 98 58 58 million kw of gener can be instal to produc 263 7 275 4 billion kwh of electr annual if the 2 012 m scheme propos by the kunm institut is adopt an extra 1 5 million kw of gener capac can be instal at the upper and lower hutiaoxia hydropow station and an addit 11 million kw of capac can be built downriv to produc an extra 21 billion kwh of electr a year h5 2 excel regul effect h5 the spigot reservoir at upper hutiaoxia and two addit huge reservoir at baijidu and xiluodu will regul the river flow to ensur good power gener qualiti h5 3 good overal benefit h5 the develop will also result in other benefit such as flood control silt irrig navig and soil preserv h5 4 better geolog condit h5 although the region is frequent struck by earthquak dam can be built in rel stabl site with better geolog condit each cascad ha the geolog condit to build a tall dam h5 5 superior technoeconom indic h5 the hydropow station at each cascad ha superior technoeconom indic such as the amount of engin work construct cost flood loss and popul reloc h3 6 major improv in transport at most hydropow station site h3 nation or provinci highway pass through site such as the upper hutiaoxia jinanqiao guanyinyan xiluodu and xiangjiaba lower hutiaoxia and baihetan are access by local road in addit most hydropow station site are locat near town and villag h3 ii develop of the jinsha jiang ha major strateg signific h3 h3 1 deliv electr from west to east to allevi energi shortag in the southeast h3 energi resourc are in short suppli in the eastern central and southern region the ship of coal produc in the north to the south put a tremend strain on transport with sustain econom growth there is a rise demand for energi and electr if we continu to reli upon coal alon it will be difficult for our product and transport system to meet our demand pollut is a major problem and it is imposs to build a larg number of costli nuclear power plant to solv our energi shortag problem the abund water energi resourc in the southwest especi the deliveri of electr power gener from the jinsha jiang eastward is an import energi resourc for the southeast on the basi of our analysi if the cascad of the jinsha jiang hydropow project are complet in 2040 50 million kw of power can be suppli to the east thi will have a major impact on allevi the energi shortag and improv the primari energi structur in the southeast h3 2 develop hydropow to lead econom growth in the southwest h3 sinc the reform although there ha been some econom growth along the jinsha jiang with the except of a few citi such as panzhihua and yibin the growth is still veri slow particularli in minor area nevertheless there is an abund of hydropow miner and biomass resourc speed up the work to develop the jinsha jiang can drive up the develop of other natur resourc in the region and improv the local economi and cultur standard it will convert it resourc advantag to econom advantag and can improv the layout of our industri structur develop the jinsha jiang can also improv the ecolog in the upper reach of the chang jiang in addit it will bring a fortun to our minor thi help solidifi us as a nation to secur our southwestern border it carri a great deal of polit and econom signific h3 3 develop of the jinsha jiang hydropow base will make the three gorg more econom benefici h3 the complet of the jinsha jiang cascad will produc a total water storag capac of 77 billion m sup 3 a regul capac of 36 billion m sup 3 and some flood control capac by regul the reservoir the flow downstream will increas in the dri season and decreas dure a flood furthermor it will also block sand from wash down the river 1 after the xiluodu reservoir is construct by way of regul the flow the citi of yibin will have the capabl to deal with a 100 year flood instead of the current 20 year flood in addit it can also reduc the flow of floodwat into the three gorg to improv it flood control capabl 2 after the xiluodu reservoir is complet the dam will block the movement of suspend materi from upstream in 30 year it can intercept 67 percent of the suspend materi the equival to reduc the suspens at yichang by 30 percent as a result it will slow down the rise of flood level at the end of the three gorg caus by silt 3 accord to an analysi done by the chengdu institut regul provid by the xiluodu reservoir can produc an addit 880 000 kw of capac to the hydropow station at xiangjiaba three gorg and gejiaba and gener 1 6 billion kwh of electr per year 4 by the regul power of the xiluodu reservoir the minimum flow dure drought season can be increas from 1 060 m sup 3 s to 2 000 m sup 3 s to improv the navig condit down the jinsha jiang and along the upper reach of the chang jiang h3 iii progress in earli stage work on jinsha jiang hydropow base h3 1 hutiaoxia cascad the hutiaoxia gorg is approxim 22 km in length and ha a 200 m drop it ha numer shoal and rapid and steep cliff on both bank most expos rock are marbl and quartzit some geolog survey and plan work wa done by the chang jiang water conserv commiss in the 1960 the south china institut ha establish a hydrolog station at the longpanba site in hutiaoxia to conduct plan stage survey work as for the develop of hutiaoxia the scheme studi in the past includ a two stage approach build two tall dam at upper and lower hutiaoxia and a hybrid approach build a tall dam at upper hutiaoxia and lead water from the right shore to a power plant in lower hutiaoxia specif with refer to the fact that the origin upper hutiaoxia dam site is too narrow design also propos to move the dam upstream to longpan where the river is wide these approach are be studi as a part of the plan work normal water level should be select primarili base on yunnan s abil to absorb flood of farmland and reloc of peopl present yunnan is lean toward a high water level plan thi not onli can gener more electr along differ stage but also can bring water to irrig approxim 1 2 million mu of farmland in central yunnan these are issu to be investig in the plan stage the next step is to studi and demonstr the scale and method of develop at hutiaoxia and to determin the normal water level in the upper hutiaoxia reservoir thi front end work need to be acceler to ensur that it play a lead role after hydropow station at xiangjiaba and xiluodu are put on line 2 jinanqiao cascad with the support of yunnan on the basi of a comparison of terrain geolog transport and construct condit the kunm institut propos to replac zhili with jinanqiao it ha also complet a plan survey the dam site is primarili cover with dens basalt and a small amount of tuff it is a better site the station is to be built behind the dam initi a 2 5 million kw station with a guarante product of 1 273 million kw is plan the scale appear to be appropri if possibl thi earli stage develop propos by yunnan should be support 3 guanyinyan cascad thi dam site primarili cover by quartzit and silt will be develop with a power plant behind the dam the kunm institut ha complet the plan survey work the plant is of an appropri size and ha the necessari condit for develop the citi of panshihua hope that construct can begin as soon as possibl regardless which one of the three propos site is chosen huap counti in yunnan will be flood by the reservoir a comprehens technoeconom analysi should be done in the earli stage to choos the most appropri site 4 baihetan cascad as earli as the 1950 under extrem difficult circumst the kunm institut conduct survey and design work with expert from czechoslovakia on thi site the east china institut ha built road and erect cabl bridg to conduct survey for the plan stage thi site is primarili cover with hard basalt it stand on solid bedrock that offer an excel geolog condit other condit for develop are also outstand it is a key project to deliv electr power from the jinsha jiang eastward moreov it regul the flow downstream at xiluodu and xiangjiaba 5 xiluodu cascad here the river channel is straight in a v shape valley bedrock mostli basalt is expos on either bank it is hard and solid geolog it is perfect for the construct of a tall dam and underground build develop condit such as construct and transport are good xiluodu is the largest hydropow station on the jinsha jiang it reservoir ha the abil to regul the river flow year round the chengdu institut ha conduct a great deal of survey and design work for sever year if the front end cost is assur a dam site select report can be prepar by the end of 1993 a feasibl report can be finish in 1995 develop of xiluodu is an ideal first phase project for the deliveri of electr from the jinsha jiang eastbound local global govern want an earli develop 6 xiangjiaba cascad the chengdu institut began site survey in 1975 these were follow by geolog survey done by the wuje hydropow survey team in 1985 the design survey respons wa switch to the south china institut in 1990 the institut of water conserv held a site select meet for the dam site vii is prefer and site iii is the altern the dam site base is sandston the south china institut is work on the hub layout at the select site perform hydraul model experi conduct geolog survey work and map navig channel thi station ha the best condit for construct and transport in addit citi such as yinbin and shuifu are close by the overal benefit of the power station is substanti furthermor it work as a revers regul reservoir for the xiluodu hydropow station it will benefit both the power grid and navig if the preliminari phase fund can be secur a feasibl report may be complet in 1984 xiangjiaba and xiluodu are sister power station they should be includ in the first phase of construct on the lower reach of the jinsha jiang h3 iv preliminari understand of the develop of the jinsha jiang h3 sinc the 1950 organ such as the chang jiang water conserv commiss kunm institut chengdu institut south china institut east china institut and the chines academi of scienc have conduct a great mani survey and plan and design work on the jinsha jiang and acquir a tremend amount of data in 1981 the chengdu institut prepar a plan to develop the lower reach sinc feasibl studi of xiluodu and xiangjiaba are in progress as time goe by mani new find will surfac as for the middl reach the kunm institut is conduct full scale plan work the survey and design work in the plan stage for the hutiaoxia cascad is be conduct by the south china institut in recent year the china electr power associ and the china societi of hydropow engin have also done a great deal of work on the develop of the jinsha jiang the follow is a discuss on strengthen the earli stage effort h5 1 stick to a basic construct process h5 we must stick to a basic construct process despit the fact that our economi is grow at a fast pace and the depth of reform is get deeper prepar of a hydropow plan report is an import stage it determin the scope phase and sequenc select of first stage work of the develop effort it is the foundat requir for a feasibl studi of everi hydropow station we must do a good job to prepar a hydropow plan report for the middl and lower reach of the jinsha jiang h5 2 studi major technoeconom issu in depth h5 the jinsha jiang is china s largest hydropow base we must rigor perform the front end prepar work and studi relat major technoeconom issu in great detail 1 on the basi of the overal develop plan of the chang jiang basin the jinsha jiang is suppos to be develop for hydropow navig irrig water suppli and flood control for area downriv there are differ requir for the differ cascad variou industri also have differ requir for the develop of the jinsha jiang some of them are extrem demand it make the plan and earli stage work veri difficult 2 although there is an abund of resourc along the jinsha jiang there is onli a limit amount of land avail for develop thi make the reloc of peopl more difficult furthermor the region belong to minor we must clearli understand the degre of difficulti in reloc the popul 3 the jinsha jiang valley is narrow and the river is swift it also contain a great deal of mud and sand the riverb ha a thick overburden layer it is locat in a high earthquak frequenc zone in addit there are problem such as high slope and reservoir bank stabil individu reservoir may leak these natur condit make the engin design and construct more difficult 4 from the standpoint of the scale of the project all hydropow station are more than 2 million kw technic requir for tall dam are veri stringent mani issu such as tall dam construct high capac water turbin gener ultrahigh voltag power transmiss technolog and divers in high flow situat must be investig some issu may requir consider develop h3 v suggest on acceler jinsha jiang hydropow develop h3 the rapid growth of our economi particularli in the southeast present an urgent need to resolv the power shortag problem develop the jinsha jiang is a way to actual deliv electr to the east moreov develop of the jinsha jiang is an import compon in the control and develop of the chang jiang and the econom strip along the chang jiang to thi end the author ha the follow suggest 1 stronger govern leadership develop of the jinsha jiang is a strateg project that will have a signific impact on the economi it should be treat as seriou as the project to divert water to the north from the south under the guidanc of the state plan commiss and the ministri of electr power industri a jinsha jiang develop offic should be establish to studi major polici issu such as hydropow develop scheme capit rais approach electr price polici right and benefit relat to provinc that own the resourc and those that consum power plu power station ownership and distribut of benefit of hydropow station border two or more provinc and shoulder invest for overal util and provid it find to the govern in the decis make process 2 expand public in order to acceler the jinsha jiang the project should be more aggress promot through a varieti of channel by differ mean to make more peopl in more depart and industri awar of the signific of build a hydropow energi base in the southwest to allow the appropri author and depart to adopt the necessari econom legal and administr measur to help implement and support thi project thi will bring more organ and more peopl to support the develop of hydropow along the jinsha jiang 3 secur earli stage fund the scale of the project to build the jinsha jiang hydropow station is enorm there will be a great deal of work at the front end for a consider period of time if construct is to begin in the year 2000 earli stage work should start now otherwis it will be too late it will serious impact the develop effort to acceler the develop of the jinsha jiang the focu now is to begin earli stage plan work of key hydropow station and site along the river to speed up thi earli stage work we need to increas the level of fund the plan and design academi is veri much concern about the earli stage work for the jinsha jiang project and ha schedul sever design unit to get involv in the earli stage work on the river section and hydropow station at xiangjiaba and xiluodu nevertheless progress is hamper due to a sever shortag of fund to solv thi problem a special request wa submit to the state plan commiss the ministri of electr power industri and the nation energi resourc invest corpor in addit base on the principl of a market economi the author should negoti with the electr util in central eastern and southern china to invest in the project for futur consumpt in order to rais money to cover the front end work and the construct cost furthermor the suggest that the three gorg develop corpor invest in the jinsha jiang project should also be follow up and nail down upon complet of the three gorg project it is a natur for the cooper to immedi develop the jinsha jiang if thi suggest is accept earli stage fund will be secur and ownership of the project will be clear it will further facilit the progress of earli stage work under the premis of increas fund through strengthen leadership and coordin requir on qualiti and progress can be further defin differ task can then be assign and variou unit can rel quickli produc qualiti plan design report if fund cannot be increas then all our effort on proof of concept and scheme will be in vain 4 speed up the plan report thi report should includ detail such as voltag of eastbound electr stage develop plan and develop sequenc it should be offici review by the govern to serv as the basi for the design of variou stage of hydropow station it should be point out that an approv river hydropow plan report is a necess to attract capit from other provinc and countri develop of the jinsha jiang is a monument task that is go to take place between thi and the next centuri as long as the govern provid stronger leadership increas the level of fund for earli stage work reli on scienc and technolog take control over plan and design formul appropri polici and obey the principl of a socialist market economi in rais construct capit there is a possibl that the jinsha jiang hydropow base project may start in 2000 by 2010 electr will be transmit eastward the jinsha jiang hydropow base will be complet by 2040
