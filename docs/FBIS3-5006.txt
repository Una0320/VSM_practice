languag f p 105 korean f articl type cso f p 106 by kim yu chong f text we are live in a hobbesian world with neither etern comrad nor etern enemi and onli have nation interest with the develop of advanc commun thi ha becom a more complex mutual depend world a world in which the competit for econom surviv is more intens than ever befor under the leadership of the unit state world polit are be interspers with conflict and strife with japan and germani head toward their apex the world economi is evolv into region bloc the histori of confus and unrest is not roll along it is move by leap and bound how are we act at thi point in time how and where shall we find our interest in the sens that we must act independ and autonom in the intern commun and are do so is the republ of korea as a sovereign nation act autonom and carri out an independ polici the korean peopl began to be awar of the nuclear issu and policymak began turn their eye toward nuclear problem or nuclear polici particularli nuclear polici toward north korea in 1989 when u s and french satellit photograph of dprk nuclear facil captur the attent of the world press befor then we onli went along with the u s ncnd neither confirm nor deni polici one part of it strategi to restrain the dprk thi wa the u s polici to neither confirm nor deni the exist of u s tactic nuclear weapon on the korean peninsula we have believ the u s ncnd polici guarante our greatest secur interest and have just follow along with it later on 8 novemb 1991 presid no tae u made hi denuclear declar even renounc nuclear enrich and reprocess one month later after proclaim the absenc of nuclear weapon he sign the dprk s agreement on reconcili nonaggress and cooper exchang cooper hwaha wa pulgachim mich kyoryu e kwanhan hapuiso without ani mention of the nuclear issu in thi agreement the govern demonstr an intent to pursu a dprk polici deal with the nuclear issu and other issu in parallel run up against strong u s dissatisfact with thi howev the govern elucid a linkag polici if the dprk nuclear issu is not resolv north south econom cooper is imposs afterward in septemb 1992 we came to support what could be call the u s greatest outstand issu the extens of the npt nuclear non prolifer treati there are still two year left until the npt extent negoti and non nuclear countri use the npt extens negoti as a opportun are look for concess despit thi we support the u s desir for an indefinit extens directli and indirectli the abov is a gener outlin of the 6th republ s nuclear polici there are more than a few problem with it first although we can acknowledg that our govern s abil to collect intellig is clearli limit becaus it ha no independ reconnaiss satellit it did not come up with an appropri respons when the dprk nuclear issu wa first rais or when the dprk admit to possess plutonium the dprk nuclear issu wa brought up a long time ago even when some expert warn of the possibl of a dprk style ncnd the govern show no movement on thi whatsoev it wa onli when the domest media start make an uproar that it began to seek a solut to the problem second in it approach to the nuclear issu the govern wa unabl to secur our interest due to a lack of expert knowledg our nuclear polici can be gener divid into two categori nuclear possess polici and non possess polici pursu by the five nuclear power the u s russia china the unit kingdom and franc the nuclear possess polici maxim militari polit and diplomat nation interest by maintain nuclear weapon although it give up nuclear weapon surrend to the pressur of the nuclear power the non possess polici seek to maxim nation interest within given condit by obtain econom and diplomat concess while argu against inequ for variou reason such as our allianc with the unit state we have had no choic but to adopt a non possess polici are we then get concess unfortun we are not our govern proclaim it renunci of nuclear weapon and even elucid that it would not maintain the enrich and reprocess facil so necessari for the peac use of nuclear energi and for deal with nuclear wast the is no nation on earth like our thi wa the first time we surrend our autonom nuclear polici as a minimum concess for give up nuclear weapon we should have at least obtain a u s effort to reduc trade pressur such as pressur to open our market third the fact that we accept as is the u s worldwid nuclear polici and it nuclear polici toward the korean peninsula clearli show our lack of an autonom nuclear polici we have overlook the fact that nuclear polit aris in the world of the zero sum game in which one side lose as much as the other side gain our lack of an autonom nuclear polici becom even clearer when we look back on u s interfer in our nuclear develop the ambiti nuclear develop program pursu by presid pak chung hi in the 1970 wa frustrat by the u s of cours it can be said that he brought thi on himself becaus he pursu it with openli militari object sinc then even the possess of enrich and reprocess facil for peac use ha been suppress in 1976 a plan to import a nuclear research reactor from canada came to noth and a plan to import mix nuclear fuel technolog from belgium wa also discontinu becaus of u s pressur the u s ha appli a first supress then see style of pressur against even nuclear technolog unrel to nuclear bomb consid the elimin of the seed of misfortun which may result from the develop of nuclear weapon more import than the econom loss of a friendli nation the u s nuclear weapon prevent polici is directli appli to our industri polici the fourth blunder of the 6th republ wa to includ the non possess of enrich and reprocess facil in it prohibit against nuclear weapon with it denuclear declar let us say that it wa a good thing to declar our abandon of nuclear weapon consid the present intern order keep small countri from possess nuclear weapon it is true that an attempt to possess nuclear weapon would not be in our nation interest howev whi did we declar that we would not maintain enrich and reprocess facil the govern did not have to includ the renunci of enrich and reprocess facil in it denuclear declar but it did thi declar wa onli in the interest of the unit state which view the growth of our militari and econom nuclear potenti as contrari to it nation interest it ha long classifi the rok as a nation have the potenti to possess nuclear weapon and surround nation thi is becaus enrich and reprocess are core technolog essenti for the nuclear energi industri although they are also need in manufactur nuclear bomb becaus of thi if a nation receiv intern inspect then there is not the least legal problem with maintain these facil thu a legal basi capabl of freez the rok s nuclear potenti and close the dprk s nuclear facil within the north south joint denuclear declar which includ the abandon of our enrich and reprocess facil is for the unit state and surround nation a mechan by which they can effortlessli achiev their aim ultim our non nuclear polici conform well with the composit of superpow hegemoni thu the nuclear polici of the 6th republ wa total ill suit for secur our interest thi 6th republ s nuclear polici failur left the new govern with press problem that is with nuclear task and dilemma it must resolv these are urgent issu the new govern must confront and solv the first dilemma is the possibl that the dprk possess nuclear weapon even though the dprk ha not openli proclaim that it possess nuclear weapon the probabl is grow that it will carri out it own style uncertainti strategi sign of thi are alreadi appear for thi strategi to succeed it must indirectli obscur it abil to possess nuclear weapon the dprk alreadi boast reprocess capabl even while awar that it is a violat of the joint denuclear declar it ha admit to possess plutonium also it ha carri out approxim 70 deton test and left sign of thi even while show sign that it is develop nuclear weapon such as rumor it is smuggl plutonium offici it still maintain that it ha neither the abil nor the intent to develop such weapon to put it anoth way contrari to our govern s cast off of all such capabl by it nuclear free and joint denuclear declar the dprk ha trick us with the joint declar and ha been success enough in drag out the nuclear issu to be a psycholog burden to us second we still need to decid on a postur concern the possibl of sanction by the intern commun against the dprk if the dprk is decept in the inspect and continu it develop of nuclear weapon there is a possibl the situat could develop into a head on collis with the nuclear hegemoni of the unit state variou senior american polit leader have alreadi hint on sever occas of the possibl of militari sanction also the dprk s continu refus to accept inspect have caus the un secur council to begin a full scale search for a solut to the problem thi will develop into a un resolut for forc inspect if even thi is refus militari action may follow diplomat and econom sanction would thi then solv the dprk nuclear issu it is in no way a simpl problem the threat of war due to a dprk retali against the rok cannot be preclud thi could result in the entir korean peninsula be pollut by nuclear radiat north south relat would enter their worst possibl state and the dream of peac coexist and unif we have so care cultiv would retreat far into the background there can be no chang in our fundament posit desir that the dprk accept inspect howev it is not in our nation interest to go beyond what is need thi is becaus the iaea intern atom energi agenc is a mechan of inequ protect the superpow s nuclear monopoli sinc the collaps of the east west composit of the intern order nuclear southern namgukhwa attempt by non nuclear countri to obtain nuclear weapon is increas at thi time the iaea ha restor it author weaken by iraq and is build a strong system outlaw nuclear weapon there is no reason for us to step too far forward sinc the nuclear issu will undoubtedli progress along with the larger current of north south relat the relationship between the possess north and the non possess south be more concern about what we can do at the level of the korean peninsula such as reopen north south talk and negoti on mutual inspect would be more in our interest third an issu we will have to worri about in the futur is nuclear energi secur thi is becaus the rok nuclear energi industri is estim to have suffer consider damag with the govern s elucid of it abandon of enrich and reprocess facil apart from simpl econom consider the mainten of enrich and reprocess facil signifi much in relat to nuclear energi secur fourth the govern of the 6th republ adopt a linkag polici as it offici posit without progress on the nuclear issu we cannot proceed with the issu of north south exchang thi is still accept as valid thi linkag polici ha behind it the at first glanc convinc argument north korea is stubbornli persist in it nuclear develop how can we offer econom cooper the problem is that thi argument is too uniform thu we need to appli a flexibl linkag polici first of all uniform linkag cannot guarante a dprk abandon of nuclear weapon the first reason for thi is that inspect is not a perfect mean of hinder nuclear develop with iaea inspect which are hamper by mani obstacl to inspect site other than report facil and mutual inspect which investig onli agre upon site we cannot be 100 sure of a dprk abandon of nuclear weapon develop when through exchang we establish a structur of interdepend between north and south korea destroy the militari util of nuclear weapon we will have found a final solut to the nuclear problem uniform linkag block exchang therefor promot an immedi resolut of the nuclear issu mutual inspect but is actual an obstacl to reach a final solut to the problem we need to understand thi fact what must be made clear at thi point is that bring up as a reason for linkag cordial diplomaci toward alli such as the unit state and japan betray simplist think unabl to understand the realism of intern polit the reason that becaus these alli maintain the posit that they will not normal relat with the dprk without a resolut of the nuclear issu we must admit that thi is illog concern the nuclear issu the u s and other nuclear power have exercis their influenc to prevent all non nuclear nation from gain nuclear capabl in order to maintain their nuclear monopoli of cours the reflect benefit gain by japan from a denuclear korean peninsula is great we must keep in mind that view from the perspect of the u s and japan both of which want a non capabl korean peninsula our linkag polici must seem to be us sacrif our own long term interest stand at the forefront of the neutral of north and south korea nambukhan muryokhwa desir by surround nation fifth is the dilemma creat by japan emerg as an asymptomat nuclear nation mujunghu haekguk a nation possess nuclear weapon that while not expos militari aim actual ha militari potenti apart from it 42 nuclear power plant present under oper japan maintain the advanc nuclear facil on an enorm scale 15 research reactor two high speed breeder reactor two convert reactor nine critic experi devic five reprocess facil five enrich facil nine nuclear fuel process facil and ten larg scale research complex in scale and qualiti the facil of north and south korea cannot compar with thi japan ha a plan to expand it exist enrich capabl to 3 000 ton by the year 2000 use an advanc laser enrich beam they can enrich uranium by over 90 percent furthermor have built the 210 ton capac tokai factori a larg scale reprocess factori with a capac of 800 ton per year is now under construct in aomori and is schedul to be complet by 1995 japan is present implement a plan to stockpil larg amount of plutonium their reason for thi is that it is need for oper their high speed breeder reactor and for their mix nuclear fuel develop japan receiv nuclear inspect and say that it use it nuclear facil and nuclear materi for peac purpos when it advanc nuclear technolog is combin with exist mean of transport the world s most advanc electron materi electron industri aviat industri and space industri it could instantli creat a formid nuclear forc while develop it peac nuclear energi industri japan ultim obtain the byproduct of thi nuclear weapon potenti japan carri out brilliant nuclear diplomaci toward the unit state by retain enrich and reprocess facilit in exchang for it 1967 announc of it three non nuclear principl in comparison one cannot help but think we have lost much the nuclear polici of the 6th republ did not reflect our nation interest well and the problem face at that time still remain dilemma thi wa becaus it lack a deep understand of the realiti of the nuclear world which move accord to the principl of hegemoni and the zero sum rule and of the doubl valu of nuclear power for us to pursu an autonom nuclear polici therefor we must understand the econom valu of nuclear power use peac as well as the realiti of the nuclear world one of the two valu of nuclear power is the polit and diplomat tool as well as the militari tool gain from possess nuclear weapon the other is the use of nuclear power to expand nation interest econom and technolog it ha been a long time sinc the fierc polit battl over nuclear power as a mean of bring at onc both nation secur and nation wealth ha becom normal between actor on the intern stage nation and terrorist group also thi battl gave birth to the nuclear non prolifer system it charact is repres by north south problem north north problem and south south problem that caus by the fierc competit and jealous between nuclear nation is the north north problem the lack of a secur guarante for non nuclear nation the distrust among non nuclear nation and so on are call south south problem look at the north south problem of nuclear power in relat to the nuclear problem of the korean peninsula it essenc is the inequ between nuclear and non nuclear nation for exampl if we look at the pillar of the nuclear non prolifer system the nuclear non prolifer treati npt it ha three nomin object these are to prevent the later prolifer of nuclear weapon to prevent the vertic prolifer of nuclear weapon and to encourag the peac use of nuclear power on closer inspect of the text howev one can quickli see that it is an unequ treati it permit vertic prolifer the continu develop and deploy of nuclear weapon by establish nuclear power while prohibit later prolifer the acquisit of nuclear weapon by non nuclear power result in their emerg as new nuclear nation compar to the time the treati went into effect the unit state and russia actual have come to possess more than three time the number of nuclear warhead they have develop multi warhead missil cruis missil and other fearsom new weapon compar to thi despit the treati s call for the encourag of the use of peac nuclear power by non nuclear nation thi articl ha in fact been made a dead letter by the nuclear power although thi is also due to the dual natur of nuclear power which result in increas capabl for it divers to militari use as a peac nuclear industri develop thi is realli becaus the hobbesian instinct of the great power to maintain a monopoli on power ha domin the nuclear order thi inequ is even more obviou in the regul on nuclear inspect they burden nuclear nation with no oblig whatsoev to accept nuclear inspect but make it obligatori that non nuclear member nation conclud a saftey meassur agreement with the iaea and open all their nuclear facil to intern inspect within 18 month thi unequ treati becam the textbook of today s nuclear world with it 146 member nation becaus of the realiti of the power differ between the great power and smaller nation recent howev the inequ of the treati ha becom a point of content in intern nuclear polit as develop nation have gradual begun voic their opposit to it a heat north south debat is predict between nuclear nation and non nuclear nation demand a price dure the negoti on extend the npt it is difficult to set up a sound autonom nuclear polici without an understand of the econom valu of peac nuclear power the problemat point of the 6th republ s nuclear polici result from a lack of nation polici deliber concern thi the econom valu of nuclear power is central relat to enrich and reprocess facil first of all enrich is the key to korean nuclear fuel of the nine nuclear reactor in use by the rok eight are light water reactor use enrich uranium as fuel as long as we have no enrich facil we are doom to import enrich uranium from foreign countri in the case of the rok the fuel fabric process is now done domest but possess no enrich facil it is miss one import element for korean nuclear fuel becaus it is a central part of the fuel cycl without the enrich process we cannot achiev the korean of the nuclear fuel cycl nor can we achiev nuclear energi secur possess eight light water reactor and have alreadi establish their economi we must no longer put off secur enrich facil thi is even more the case given the energi secur natur of the problem also just as with enrich facil as long as we have no reprocess facil it will be imposs to make our nuclear industri truli advanc the gain brought by reprocess are as follow first reprocess produc sever hundr varieti of isotop includ transuranium isotop possibl to produc onli by reprocess use for a varieti of purpos medic agricultur industri measur instrument chemic compound synthesi and so on second some uranium remain in the nuclear fuel after use thi is also a valuabl resourc third through reprocess a valuabl resourc for nuclear energi plutonium is extract from spent nuclear if the rok onli had reprocess facil it could extract 2 4 ton of plutonium everi year from 240 ton of use nuclear fuel plutonium is use as fuel for high speed breeder reactor an almost magic nuclear reactor use plutonium as a fuel to creat new plutonium the high speed breeder reactor make possibl an epoch make recycl of resourc extend the use of uranium over 60 time lastli reprocess itself is an invalu peac technolog for treat nuclear energi byproduct it divid and treat resourc to be recycl from wast materi to be dispos of abandon such preciou enrich and reprocess facil the 8 novemb denuclear declar wa noth more than a result of our obedi to the hegemoni seek non prolifer polici of the nuclear power who seek to prevent both north and south korea from possess nuclear weapon potenti onc we possess these facil we will have consider polit and diplomat influenc on the intern stage no lengthi explan is need when we consid the gain made by the dprk with one not even complet built reprocess facil at the same time advanc nuclear energi signifi our influenc as a peopl after reunif as thi cannot be achiev in a day we must understand that we are wast preciou time what then would be an autonom nuclear polici what our nuclear polici must be and where we must go have alreadi been reveal in the matter discuss abov to enumer these a littl more systemat we must complet two suprem task one is that we must wipe out the nuclear threat from our immedi enemi the dprk the other is that we must set up a nuclear polici prepar for unif take into account the dual natur of the dprk as our companion who togeth with us must achiev unif in the futur to establish and promot an autonom nuclear polici first we must revers our abandon of enrich and reprocess facil and secur these facil as soon as possibl second we must activ nurtur our nuclear energi industri and make an issu of the u s discriminatori polici which deni us even the basic while permit japan enrich and reprocess as well as allow it to stockpil larg quantiti of plutonium third by rais our intellig capabl and gain eye we must cultiv a space industri so that we do not depend intellig provid by foreign countri fourth we must clearli renounc militari use of nuclear power and increas open and self inspect one step we must limit to nuclear weapon our undress togeth nuclear polici toward dprk and to the extent that is legal we must switchov to a dress togeth nuclear polici while not permit imbal between north and south korea fifth convert from an uncondit linkag polici to a select one we must search for a north south dialog separ the nuclear and exchang issu sixth is elev our diplomat imag on the intern stage by particip in third world nuclear diplomaci while improv the one side korean american nuclear relationship make it more of a partnership if we admit that we should establish and promot an autonom nuclear polici learn from the 6th republ s nuclear polici then there is still a chanc for us we must play our part in the diplomat battl to take place in the npt negoti open in 1995 in our posit we must hurri the develop of nuclear energi if for no other reason than to minim the dilemma left to us by the nuclear polici of the 6th republ in the sens of maxim the use of the dual natur of nuclear power and of approach secur and energi issu simultan the year 1995 then will truli be our best opportun for secur the right to unlimit equal use of nuclear power by make the most of our negoti abil as a plan for use thi opportun product we can first think of a stage approach first of all while support a limit three to five year extens of the npt as a non nulcear member we need to align ourselv with the posit advoc by the third world in the second stage through negoti with the unit state we receiv a guarante of our right to legitim peac use of nuclear power the rok should consid support an indefinit or 25 year extens of the npt in the third stage under the condit that our right to the autonom use of nuclear power is secur in the second stage the rok must revis the inadequ korean american nuclear energi agreement hanmi wojaryok hyopjong and while receiv inspect improv it present statu as an uninspect countri unabl to handl plutonium it is obviou that as long as we guarante transpar and compli with intern inspect there should be no restrict on our research and develop of civilian technolog such as enrich and reprocess the past s hasti express of a support posit toward the unit state is now taboo we must understand that the era ha pass in which thi form of nuclear diplomaci is justifi under the name of diplomat realiti nuclear diplomaci must no longer be the exclus properti of one ministri we must understand that the time ha come when there is no problem with most nuclear diplomaci progress in the open after receiv the offici approv of the relev organ and public opinion in januari of thi year we sign a chemic weapon treati in hi septemb 1992 speech befor the un presid roh tae woo said that we would do thi so we had no choic of cours thi sign wa done without ani mention of the larg number of chemic weapon maintain by the dprk we demand no concess of the unit state either the diplomat realtiy logic wa onc again emphas it s okay to give sooner what we have to give eventu anyway nuclear polici must not be repeat in thi way it would be absurd for us to promis support for an indefinit extens of the npt befor the u s begin underwat diplomaci in earnest
