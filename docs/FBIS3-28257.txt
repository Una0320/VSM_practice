languag f p 105 indonesian f articl type bfn f p 106 excerpt of interview with arifin siregar ambassador to f the unit state by tempo correspond bambang harymurti in washington date not given text harymurti how are current indonesia u s relat siregar you know that relat between indonesia and the unit state in the past few year have been quit good in polit indonesia ha been activ in solv the cambodian problem and thi ha benefit the unit state the indonesian and u s govern have also work togeth well in intern forum such as in the asia pacif econom cooper apec and the uruguay round meet harymurti did indonesia and the unit state alway hold similar view dure the uruguay round talk siregar of cours there are alway differ of opinion but we do not belong to the group of countri obstruct the uruguay round talk in econom tie our bilater trade grow steadili our export last year stood at u s 4 5 billion and our import at u s 3 5 billion while u s export to indonesia stood at u s 4 3 billion harymurti so bilater trade is more or less balanc siregar that is right from the indonesian point of view the u s market ha great potenti u s invest in indonesia especi in oil ga and mine stand at about u s 25 billion while it nonoil and nonga invest are at about u s 3 2 billion the unit state is the fifth largest investor in indonesia after japan hong kong taiwan and south korea harymurti what is the impact on bilater relat of the u s threat to remov gener system of prefer gsp facil siregar bilater relat are quit cordial more than 10 000 mayb even 12 000 indonesian student are now studi in the unit state mani have complet their studi and return home view from variou angl bilater relat are quit excel it is therefor regrett if relat are strain due to the gsp and human right issu harymurti the gsp facil involv onli a small fraction of indonesian export to the unit state whi doe the govern appear to be nervou about the possibl remov of gsp facil siregar it is true that onli u s 640 million were deriv from the gsp facil from our export to the unit state in 1992 which stood at u s 4 5 billion but if the gsp facil are discontinu thi move may strain bilater relat as you know indonesia ha been view in a neg way sinc the dili incid on 12 novemb 1991 thi problem continu to exist and may flare up again anytim we wit u s senat feingold s attempt to ban the sale of arm to indonesia we notic that the u s press often view indonesia as a gross violat three preced word in english of human right and thi trend will emerg when the gsp facil are inde withdrawn in februari therefor i hope a satisfactori solut to the issu will soon be found otherwis the neg consequ will be far greater harymurti howev the main problem lie with the u s congress and nongovernment organ not the u s govern how do you cope with them siregar that is true the dili incid is the most difficult issu and thi will be a medium or long term issu we need time to solv it in view of the fact that the u s polit system is differ from that of other countri includ indonesia we cannot say that the main problem lie with the u s congress and nongovernment organ all of them should be seen as interdepend agenc the gsp issu is one exampl nongovernment organ such as asia watch and the afl cio are the agenc that take the initi to have our gsp remov but it is the u s govern that make the decis the same is true with the feingold amend name a senat tabl the bill but if congress had approv it the u s govern would have implement the resolut to ban the arm sale therefor they are insepar my person view is that bilater relat should not be strain by the gsp and worker right issu harymurti there are fear that onc the gsp is remov other countri will follow the u s exampl is that true siregar that is possibl becaus worker right are also part of human right harymurti what is the outcom of the ilo team s recent visit to indonesia they said that some of indonesia s labor regul are not up to the intern standard siregar i have not yet receiv a complet report on the issu but at a hear on 3 novemb 1993 the indonesian govern through it ambassador said that it would take step to improv worker welfar thi is not due to the u s request hope the govern will realli take step for the benefit of it own peopl and also as a mean to appeas the american harymurti what about the case of marsinah labor activist murder in east java siregar well it is one of the case the govern ha taken appropri action anybodi believ to be involv in the case will be put on trial and the court will pass it judgment soon harymurti what categori of u s investor are believ to have the strongest potenti in indonesia the medium or small scale investor siregar there are sever categori let us say that the freeport corpor is a big one but there are also mani medium scale investor all of whom have invest a total of u s 3 2 billion as i mention earlier i see more potenti for our export to the unit state which are project to increas by 25 percent next year harymurti what is the rank of our export to the unit state compar to that to other countri siregar in term of nonoil and nonga export the valu of our export to the unit state is almost equival to that to japan name at u s 3 9 billion out total export to japan stand at u s 10 8 billion thi mean that the unit state ha becom our second largest market for export as for the unit state the valu of it import from indonesia rank 23rd harymurti what kind of invest can we expect from the unit state siregar we can still expect a lot of u s invest in the oil and ga sector an exampl is a project by exxon if it inde materi it will be worth between 20 and 40 billion howev negoti are still under way for the nonoil and nonga sector u s invest is still far smaller than that of japan korea hong kong and taiwan harymurti what effort do you believ should be exert to boost bilater tie with the unit state siregar i believ promot campaign on trade tourism and invest should be intensifi becaus mani u s businessmen still do not have adequ inform about indonesia perhap these businessmen will becom potenti investor therefor i plan to visit michigan louisiana georgia minnesota and texa along with member of the u s asean council to persuad u s businessmen to invest in indonesia or buy more indonesian product harymurti there are report that mani would be investor are complain about the lack of legal protect in indonesia and also consid them as an obstacl to invest siregar thi is the typic attitud of american and western peopl in gener they cannot make decis quickli they must look at mani aspect first especi the legal one for thi reason countri like korea and hong kong tend to invest more in indonesia harymurti some observ said that sinc the apec meet in seattl there ha been a shift in the u s govern s stand on human right and environ issu siregar it is too earli to say that we must not forget one thing worth pay attent to name dure the nafta debat the u s govern strain it relat with the trade union the relat were so strain that presid clinton found it necessari to hold a special meet with lane kirkland chairman of the trade union we never know whether clinton had to give some sort of concess to the unionist on certain labor right it is inde worth note that the apec meet in seattl ha indirectli made us the focu of the u s public s interest perhap we will reap it posit impact howev the nafta debat may also have a neg impact harymurti do you attach great import to the fact that indonesia will host the apec meet next year siregar ye i believ it is good for us to host the meet becaus the leader meet two preced word in english will be held for the second time i believ thi is veri import harymurti therefor are you optimist that indonesia u s relat will continu to improv siregar i cannot say that i am veri optimist and i have to be cautiou here becaus we never know how the gsp issu will turn out i believ the gsp issu is crucial and i hope it will be solv properli but when the gsp issu is solv it doe not mean that everyth will proceed smoothli becaus the east timor issu is still haunt us harymurti until when siregar it will take some time to find the solut right now there are still protest demonstr in seattl and washington d c on east timor even though the the u s press prais indonesia s econom perform they alway tri to find someth neg thi is especi true with the washington post which often carri disturb report about indonesia harymurti as a former director of imf do you think the polici of the imf and world bank will be influenc by the human right and democrat reform issu siregar there are sign toward that end becaus donor nation are mostli western countri for exampl the world bank earlier paid no attent to environ issu after the world bank wa heavili critic it now pay attent to the matter the same is true with the human right issu becaus the major of world bank sharehold are western nation which will of cours put their prioriti first an exampl is that the imf wa earlier reluct to give loan to vietnam the influenc of big countri on thi issu can be felt directli or indirectli even though staff member of thi financi institut may voic their opposit to certain decis the decis make process lie in the hand of countri which are big sharehold
