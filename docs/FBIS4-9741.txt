cso f p 106 articl by german duqu first paragraph is el espectador f introduct text a glanc at the presidenti econom program is pastrana the same as gaviria doe samper make the differ do conserv and liber have practic ident plan everyon talk about reconvers in their econom polici but gener speak they have not restructur their idea and program pastrana preserv almost everyth in gaviria s program even the same statist some differ can be found in samper s propos especi becaus of hi emphasi on employ polici and the farm sector although the countri may be in the same econom situat as it wa four year ago it doe not seem logic that the propos for deal with the problem would be just as ident or at least veri similar to those put forward four year ago it is clear that the countri s statist are out of date but it is also true that the structur problem are still here it is sad howev to see thing be treat just the same while at the same time the great chang is trumpet the overal diagnosi inde could be the same a minor with great prosper surround by ever greater opportun and a major with seriou surviv problem and a lack of opportun in thi regard in the spirit of chang that the variou polit campaign are promot one might hope that for exampl some conserv propos would be markedli differ from those made by the liber and of cours clearli differ from those of a liber govern otherwis we could not talk of chang but of continu on the latter point howev it would be worth consid the possibl appropri in mani case of a liber candid continu the strategi of a liber govern as predecessor and current administr nonetheless in both situat one would expect more ambiti and aggress propos come from the opposit parti sinc the idea is to close the gap between the have and the have not if the central diagnosi is realli true and correct an initi face valu analysi of the featur of gaviria s peac revolut plan compar to pastrana s and samper s current propos clearli reveal that there are tremend similar among them especi between the first two those of gaviria and pastrana it could be said that pastrana like what gaviria did so much that he want to keep it all practic unchang but it could also be said that gaviria left so mani thing unfinish that pastrana and samper would like to continu them that is not necessarili a bad thing either becaus a highway should not be left half done or an aqueduct without water simpli becaus of a chang in govern the surpris thing is that some peopl seem to want to copi other program to the letter plain and simpl for exampl in the area of infrastructur pastrana propos rehabilit 1 600 kilomet of railway gaviria s plan contain the same figur but it is unlik in that sector with ferrovia go full steam ahead that even 10 percent of the network ha manag to be improv pastrana would be right to propos it again if inde noth had been accomplish in that sector except for the payment of huge sum of compens to the trade union anoth exampl pastrana say he will seek to turn 500 000 hectar into suitabl farmland gaviria propos thi same figur four year ago and if i recal correctli lopez michelsen propos the same thing 16 year ago when he creat the himat for the same purpos it could be argu that pastrana is right for undertak such a project sinc it wa appar too much for the gaviria administr to accomplish in the case of water gaviria contend that 11 million colombian did not have potabl water servic a seriou symptom of poverti or of nbi unsatisfi basic need as it is call now pastrana is concern about the same 11 million peopl s need for thi vital liquid can it be that the countri ha not ad a singl liter of water to it servic in the last four year it would appear that the samper camp or the samper case sure becaus he spent part of the time away from the gaviria administr ha not been as anesthet or as support of the peac revolut regard the initi we have been comment on in the area of infrastructur they are not clear becaus the govern platform ha not been present in it entireti on the other hand it is clear that in the macroeconom sphere samper is interest in make all of the econom machineri revolv around massiv job creation he think that job are the start point for prosper in ani colombian famili and he ha specif pledg to creat more than 1 million new job mayb thi is the characterist that most distinguish pastrana from gaviria hi emphasi on job with regard to the liber of the economi both pastrana and samper propos that it be consolid but the latter is not as enamor of wholesal import without reciproc in trade relat a key element in the internation of the economi what thi mean is that colombia would onli buy from those who buy it product someth like the fight that ha alreadi start between the unit state and japan seriou advoc of free trade all of the propos from gaviria to the present have in common idea for industri reconvers export promot job train product competit etc etc in short the usual menu for counteract drastic liber program thi is a contrast to the now famou asian tiger who first reconvert and made technolog and human capit advanc and then went out into the intern market to bare their sharp teeth here is a chart compar gaviria s govern program and samper s and pastrana s propos h5 economi h5 h5 cesar gaviria h5 acceler growth predict until an averag of 5 percent a year is
