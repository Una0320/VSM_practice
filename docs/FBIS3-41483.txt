amount of timber that is cut thu there is no reason for concern on thi score but to a larg extent the age finnish forest are also so call manag forest forest that have alreadi been affect by log and forest manag these forest lack the realli old tree the dead and rot tree and veget that mani fungi beetl moss and lichen need for surviv we have talk a lot in finland about forestri and how to take care of our manag forest without pay enough attent to the ecolog dimens and the multipl of speci said chief supervisor pertti rassi of the environ ministri nor ha enough research been done in the 1980 s on the effect effici forestri ha had on the flora and fauna in our forest but now there is agreement that ecolog must be taken into account in forest manag and no irrepar damag ha yet occur accord to rassi he is also chairman of the work group that is make an inventori of finland s old forest the inventori of southern finland is complet but work is still be done on a list of forest in lapland there is also a polit consensu on the need to protect our last natur forest and the govern could issu a direct as earli as next week on the preserv of around 10 000 hectar of state own forestland in southern finland there is also a need to protect around 5 000 hectar of privat land but accord to rassi thi will be an expens oper h5 thicket scrub growth scarc h5 around two third of finland is cover with forest today and around 2 percent of the forest are part of a protect area in the southern part of the countri onli 1 percent of the forest are protect the big protect area are north of uleaborg accord to rassi there are also gap in the map that wa done to determin the protect need in lapland south of the arctic circl and there is a special need for increas forest protect in thi area we estim that there are at least 65 000 hectar of forest worth protect in lapland said rassi whose work group ha now receiv an expand mandat to inventori the lapland forest most of the project protect area are locat on state own land even if region forestri board were reprimand for log and inadequ protect of their forest there would be no veri old forest left on privat own land rassi point out privat forest and those belong to log compani have been manag accord to econom principl in order to produc the biggest possibl yield h5 research lag behind h5 sound forestri becam a common term back in the 1980 s but the concept wa not given much weight in finland accord to the environ ministri supervisor biodivers and the multipl of speci have been lack in forest research here while in sweden for exampl it ha been includ in research sinc the 1970 s when they began discuss these issu there the endang speci in finland that have receiv the most public and are die out precis becaus of the lack of old forest are the white back woodpeck and the fli squirrel but there are also other woodpeck speci and mani kind of beetl and fungi that do not surviv in manag forest there is not enough space for speci that live sole in thicket or in old scrub growth in particular when consid which area should be preserv and protect forest age and structur are taken into account rassi note the idea is to make it possibl to ensur the surviv of speci in these area and to provid a suffici vari forest environ that also contain old and rot tree h5 speci must now be preserv h5 the basi for forest manag today one that all side are in rel agreement on is to prevent other speci from die out in our forest rassi said one problem is that as a result of the lack of research in the 1980 s we lack a clear pictur of what ha actual been lost he complain but if we look at research result from sweden and tri to appli them here around 15 percent of finnish forest should be protect to safeguard biodivers preserv the anim speci that exist today will be a veri demand task accord to rassi to do thi approxim 1 million hectar of forest would have to be design as protect area and we are not yet even halfway there he said there are simpli not enough econom resourc to protect all the forest that should be includ howev forestri can be manag differ and in recent month the peopl in charg of practic log oper in the forest have been retrain in accord with the principl of sound forestri rassi said there is also agreement on which method are sound he said so these kind of measur should eventu be seen in the forest one problem when one discuss forest and growth is that the time perspect is so long that it is hard to see the result of variou measur in the period of a singl gener h5 forest get along without us h5 it will be five or 10 year befor we have research result that tell us what should be done in the forest even though we need the result now rassi point out much time will be lost befor the decis that are made by politician and the author get down to the concret level in the forest i fear the worst that could happen is a failur to prevent more speci from becom extinct and a continu declin in the number of speci that caus irrepar damag if we get into a situat where fungi lichen and beetl have disappear and the forest cannot get along without human assist and intervent we will have caus irrepar damag he point out in the past forest renew themselv as a result of forest fire for exampl and rassi think control burn is still a good way to renew forest unfortun it is also an expens method he note the age structur in our forest is such that the forest are now grow older and effici forestri and manag forest have not caus ani damag that cannot be repair in rassi s opinion he is now hope for a comprehens inventori that also includ privat forest the work group that is current review the forest in lapland should finish the job in 1995
