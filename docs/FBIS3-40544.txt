languag f p 105 japanes f articl type cso text japan electron industri develop associ jeida and other have establish a guidelin control low frequenc electromagnet interfer gener by comput display thi action is taken in respons to user anxieti express over possibl hazard effect of an electromagnet wave on human bodi the associ s member firm will self impos the standard on product destin for the domest market sweden s mpr ii standard is use as refer in formul the regul target product are crt and liquid crystal display the question of possibl hazard effect of low frequenc electromagnet interfer on human bodi gener by comput display had surfac mani time dure the past 10 year or more until now howev no definit conclus ha been offer perhap it is not the type of question which can yield a clear cut conclus under such circumst a short cut to dispel user anxieti is to control a level of emiss of low frequenc electromagnet interfer consid hazard to health in octob 1993 jeida and japan busi machin maker associ establish a guidelin concern low frequenc electromagnet interfer gener by display use in inform process equip hereinaft refer to as the guidelin the guidelin design allow emiss level to control the intens of electromagnet interfer gener by comput display the establish guidelin is applic not onli to crt but also to liquid crystal and plasma display measur procedur and condit of electr and magnet interfer also will be regul h5 applic of guidelin will begin in 1996 in stage h5 japan electron industri develop associ will treat the guidelin as the industri s self impos regulatori control for now firm which are member of the associ will self impos the guidelin on their product sold on the domest market ampl time is allow befor the regulatori guidelin becom effect it ha been state that the guidelin will be applic onli to those product manufactur after januari 1996 after januari 1998 howev all product are said to be subject to the regulatori guidelin in octob 1991 moreov the jeida ha establish a standard regul display s static electr at that time the electron industri associ of japan s name appear as one of those involv in develop specif in establish a standard thi time howev jeida ha defer the particip of the electron industri associ of japan h5 japan tri to catch up with u s and europ h5 japan lag somewhat behind the unit state and europ in the regulatori aspect of handl low frequenc electromagnet interfer in the unit state and europ it is becom a common practic for both end user and comput maker to ensur that product satisfi design emiss level in accord with the establish regul similar to japan s guidelin mpr ii establish by sweden s offici organ swedac swedish board for technic accredit is the standard most frequent consult especi in europ thi is becom essenti to the point that no matter how inexpens product are the market demand that product adher to the standard establish by mpr ii accord to a technician work for a display maker although the number of mpr ii product for the domest market ha been increas in japan still there are a larg number of product to which no standard ha been appli one of the reason is that japanes user are not as demand in thi respect as their european and american counterpart howev the situat may chang overnight anticip thi the jeida made a move to establish a guidelin h5 lenient on regul of electr field emiss h5 in mani way the guidelin follow mpr ii mpr ii standard product therefor will be automat given the seal of approv the low frequenc rang of electr and magnet field allow by the regul as well as the method of measur basic is the same as those of mpr ii level of electr interfer allow by the japanes guidelin and mpr ii howev differ wide those establish by japan electron industri develop associ are 50v m or 250v m with band i 5hz 2khz and 10v m for band ii 2khz 400khz which are consider more lenient than the mpr ii s design valu of 25v m band i and 2 5v m band ii the associ s target valu for band i vari depend on whether ground is possibl or not the target valu for the magnet field are the same as mpr ii s in set the allow level of interfer japan electron industri develop associ consid standard movement other than mpr ii at present the unit state s ieee institut of electr and electron engin inc and europ s ecma european comput manufactur associ are studi similar guidelin the associ use the figur appear in a draft of the ecma 172 standard differ between the japan electron industri develop associ s standard and mpr ii lie in cost involv to achiev target valu the target valu of mpr ii ha been determin by consid two factor that it is within the rang of the technic feasibl and that thi can be achiev without spend a substanti amount sinc effect of electromagnet interfer on human bodi is not clear at thi time the target valu are determin pure on a technic basi the target valu establish by japan electron industri develop associ are aim for the level which enabl japan to manufactur display at lower cost than that of the mpr ii product even at these target valu sinc they are substanti lower than the standard set in field other than display we believ that it will be easi for jeida to achiev it goal reason whi onli the target valu of electr interfer are set high is electr interfer is more difficult to mitig than magnet interfer a technician from a display maker in order to control electr interfer gener by display we have either to lower intern gener electr interfer itself or to use shield for instanc with crt we can use a shield method by mix coat with a conduct materi and appli it to a tube surfac howev thi method can be extrem costli if materi with superior shield characterist are to be develop refer 1 nakamori imai eda technolog gentl to human bodi
