bfn f p 106 commentari by k s jayraman f text the report that japan s fast breeder reactor is expect to go critic should be good news to india s nuclear scientist india and japan appear to be the onli two countri pursu the breeder technolog in today s world that ha becom hostil to thi new sourc of electr power the hostil stem from two reason one is the safeti consider becaus of the complex technolog involv in breeder reactor it is for thi reason that franc which pioneer the breeder technolog decid to shut down it 1 200 megawatt fast breeder reactor to appreci the second reason one must know what a breeder is the fast breeder reactor ha a core made of plutonium fuel surround by a blanket of natur uranium dure the chain reaction more plutonium is creat in the blanket than what is consum in the core and henc the name breeder one simpli ha to remov the blanket extract the plutonium and build anoth breeder with it or use the plutonium to build a bomb it is thi possibl of nuclear prolifer that is at the heart of the american campaign against plutonium in the unit state spent nuclear fuel is not reprocess to recov plutonium and washington doe not want ani other nation to produc plutonium even for power gener becaus of it fear that it can be divert for bomb interest in fast breeder declin for yet anoth reason in the 1970 s it wa anticip that a spread of convent reactor would lead to a shortag of uranium and make plutonium the fuel of choic but thi did not happen japan reli almost total on the outsid world for energi it see fast breeder technolog is a promis rout to reduc thi depend japan s prototyp fast breeder reactor monju will produc 280 megawatt when it begin full oper next year india s compuls to go into fast breeder technolog is dictat by the fact that while it uranium resourc are limit it ha larg deposit of thorium which can be turn into a nuclear fuel in order to effici make thi convers india ha to build fast breeder reactor with core made of plutonium and blanket out of thorium india s fast breeder test reactor at kalpakkam near madra is about 10 year old but it power level is nowher near the design 40 megwatt it ha succeed in convinc indian scientist that the technolog is difficult to master but not imposs to learn india no doubt is way behind japan in har thi power sourc but it consol is that it is not alon in pursu thi technolog whether india will be abl to commit enough resourc to pursu it goal like japan is howev a big question mark
