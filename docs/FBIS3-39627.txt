languag f p 105 danish f articl type cso f p 106 interview with prime minist poul nyrup rasmussen by f lisbeth knudsen and ole lorenzen place and date not given the critic you learn from text after one year as prime minist the fight against unemploy and the effort on behalf of the less privileg still ha top prioriti poul nyrup rasmussen will never abandon hi hope of get a job for everyon but the prime minist would rather promis too littl than too much he ha said mani of the same thing for a year and he ha thought about persist in say them in 1994 and 1995 as well dane will hear a prime minist talk about whether we will do someth about unemploy despit public opinion poll and politician from the parti that make up the coalit govern as well that say that we will never again see full employ that is an opinion to which poul nyrup rasmussen will not subscrib the social democrat parti sdp will never abandon it hope of creat a framework in our countri within which everyon can be activ regardless of whether econom condit turn up or down it is our basic point of departur that everyon should be abl to work said poul nyrup rasmussen in advanc of the govern s first anniversari next tuesday employ wa the main issu when the govern came into offic and it will be the main issu for mani year to come but we are talk about full employ that is differ from what we knew in the 1960 s work will be better distribut we can inde get everyon work but it should be clear that that mean join with the chang in valu that ha occur peopl also want to have time left over just to have thing if we just want to have more thing then that is when the pinch will come the prime minist said det fri aktuelt but do you believ that a reduct in unemploy from 350 000 to 330 000 by the end of thi year is enough to convinc peopl that we can achiev full employ rasmussen it is true that at the end of 1993 unemploy had not come down enough but there is so much forc in thi that if we have a chanc to continu our work then it will succeed all the same i do not exclud the possibl that the number will get better becaus there is so much spring come in the economi but in contrast to the former govern i will not predict anyth that cannot be achiev i would rather give a realist cautiou view h5 a better daili life h5 but even if employ is still the main issu the govern s agenda is not exhaust poul nyrup rasmussen ha a number of point that dane will hear about in the month to come rasmussen the first thing is that the reform must work in practic it doe not surpris me that with such major reform there are administr problem everyth cannot work from day one so togeth with the citi we must see to it that everyon get the messag with regard to tax reform i can veri well sit here and say that 770 000 retire out of 800 000 will get tax cut that is no help it is each individu who should know what the chang mean det fri aktuelt but ha your govern been good enough about inform peopl about thi rasmussen no we haven t we have to work on thi throughout all of 1994 but for exampl with regard to retire it is import for me to emphas that they will get their money there will be a shift in the time but they will get it the govern s second task will be to come up with visibl improv in peopl s everyday live in select area rasmussen we have just start with regard to child care i mention the child care guarante in my open speech to the folket thi ha not been forgotten in negoti with the citi we will see to it that by the end of 1995 everyon will be abl to have their child care for from the time it is one year old second there is the health sector we want to bring the wait period down to three month we want to get the bed out of the corridor the third point is servic to the elderli and those live alon where we will see to it that peopl come and visit them thi is not just a matter of whether there are enough home care helper but of make sure there are a number of other import peopl nearbi who can help fourth those peopl who live quiet live in the shadow regardless of whether they are mental ill or handicap will have better daili live we will creat framework so they will have a better life h5 real result h5 he is pleas with the way thi first year ha turn out tax reform labor market reform and leav of absenc provis are the biggest reform to have been implement in the past 10 year and the prime minist doe not agre with critic within hi parti about the lack of a social democrat profil and the talk that the govern is still nonsocialist rasmussen i have heard voic from that choru i would say two thing about thi histori ha also taught us that social democrat minor govern do not have difficulti achiev a profil but sometim they have difficulti turn the profil into real result basic i have been concern after 10 year in the opposit with one singl thing social democrat posit should be turn into practic result not 100 percent thing have realli never been that way nor were they in our earlier histori but good progress in the right direct that i believ we have achiev the worst thing that could happen between 25 januari last year and the elect at the end of thi one would be if peopl could say to a govern head up by the social democrat well you promis a lot but you didn t do anyth det fri aktuelt so you aren t afraid that the outcom of the elect for the sdp will be affect by the fact that you as prime minist have had to agre to an aw lot of compromis to get the govern to stay togeth rasmussen no i m not afraid of that social democrat voter and voter gener speak have a veri good sens of what the work condit are the sdp ha alway been will to cooper with other parti social democrat voter know full well that result come about onli through consciou cooper if i seem optimist it is becaus what we put our effort into we have implement and now the result are start to show we will be veri care to see to it that the system that are now set up do not get defend just for the sake of the system we want to be readi to listen and make adjust where that is necessari h5 no to a presidenti elect h5 det fri aktuelt but suppos we turn thing around there are two parti in the govern that look as if they will be wipe out as consequ of be part of the coalit govern won t you have to be veri consider of them rasmussen i am convinc that the center democrat cd will see an increas influx of voter the cd ha a joint respons for econom polici and social polici the cd is also a social awar parti that will not go along with extens social cut so combin with their preoccup with busi polici the cd voter will also acknowledg that with regard to the christian peopl s parti from the begin the parti ha put great emphasi on famili polici the christian peopl s parti can rightli point out that the parti ha had a lot to do with the chang that are now occur for famili with children det fri aktuelt will there also be room for them in an elect that is about poul nyrup rasmussen or uff ellemann jensen rasmussen here there is a bit of an influenc from the wave we have been see from the unit state thi preoccup with individu the upcom folket elect ha been call a presidenti elect between uff ellemann jensen and myself i do not look upon it that way on the one hand i will show up ani time when we have to discuss polici posit and platform what doe the liber parti want what do the sdp and the govern want i veri much want to take part in discuss thi and there will be no shortag of involv and appear on the other hand i will have to back out if uff ellemann jensen want to engag in mudsling if so he ll have to find someon els to play with person issu ha it unavoid place in the modern media pictur but it must never gain the upper hand a discuss between the liber parti on the one hand and the sdp on the other is a much too simplifi pictur of danish polit there should be room for all parti my effort will alway be to have everi shade of opinion repres that exist in the pictur there should also be room for the cd to have it profil for the christian peopl s parti to have it and the radic liber to have it h5 you shouldn t get shaken up h5 det fri aktuelt nevertheless don t you think some when as prime minist you see your parti dip under 30 percent in the opinion poll rasmussen in a job such as thi you think long and hard primarili you say to yourself that one week s opinion poll two week opinion poll the summer of 1993 s opinion poll can be hard to take a bit of concern and alarm can spread but deep down insid you tell yourself you ve got time for yourself and what you re do go to the troubl of explain what we re in the process of do it s clear that there were time dure the summer of 1993 when there were major demand place on my own sturdi it may well be that nice thing will not alway be written but that s now the way it is in danish polit you shouldn t get shaken up by a littl neg critic but i make a major distinct between whether it is person critic or critic becaus of the job you have the latter you can put up with and you ve got to learn from it det fri aktuelt have you thought about celebr the anniversari on tuesday rasmussen we ll celebr with a govern meet an even meet at which we will first discuss polit and then we ll sit down with one anoth have a drink and have a good time
