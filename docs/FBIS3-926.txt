right here terreblanch interrupt i will appreci that du preez at 1905 he ask me to talk to eugen terreblanch i told him that the imag of the awb in bophuthatswana is extrem neg and racist the sensit in the bophuthatswana secur forc regard the awb is unbeliev i ask him courteous and polit to leav mr terreblanch then told me thi night i will never forget it ha been a terribl humili i want to fight

that he say it is true terreblanch well let me answer that i now want to refer to a later discuss i spoke to gener turner not brigadi on more than one occas it wa decid between him and the gener that the awb paus appar mr cronj wa under the impress that the awb wa present in uniform with flag and so forth i wa engag in a discuss with him when he ask me if we have symbol denot rank flag and uniform i told him that the order wa for the men to move in in civilian cloth he ask turner what hi impress wa and gener turner is regard as a veri honor man he said that he ha no problem sinc the men are in civilian cloth he ad that it is a civilian forc present and the awb is prepar to plan jointli the transfer of power to the planner now i want to say that it is veri strang that a venu wa prepar for the awb becaus at a stage when the awb number rose to between 400 and 500 there were 60 member of our other volksfront nation front friend a venu wa prepar and food packag were hand out mattress were hand out the intent wa to keep us there not to see us go away at 0500 and one ha to be honest at 0500 i had anoth discuss on the insist of gen turner and he told me the politician feel that i terrebl should leav the territori becaus the black popul were becom agit at my presenc there lengthi discuss were held fortun i wa not alon and two senior gener on my staff were present the gener wa veri disappoint i said that i would leav with my men upon which one of my gener said that if i withdraw then the entir awb would withdraw the gener wa veri apologet and said the decis is not hi but come from mr rowan cronj thi came hour after an agreement for us to stay and for us to be part of the arm civilian forc there i kept my word and i went to my men and withdrew in my person capac if you look at the realiti that i did withdraw and that my men did stay then it clearli indic the agreement made i withdrew person my gener stay behind they would form part of the offens weapon would be hand out after which bophuthatswana would be stabil and thi is the situat until that point du preez let s have some question now du plessi mr terreblanch despit the argument over who invit whom it is clear to me that neither the polit leader of bophuthatswana nor their militari leader want you or your forc there but there is also a second reason whi you should not have been there ani good gener befor commit himself to a battl would gather as much intellig as possibl befor the time your own peopl are quot in the newspap the citizen say the awb command advis him on the radio to withdraw immedi from the base becaus the awb men would not stand a chanc against the armor vehicl of the bdf bophuthatswana defens forc you ought to have known that your men stood no chanc against them you yourself said that in africa a white man without a rifl is a dead man but five peopl die and they had rifl it seem to me that in africa a white man without sens and without good judgment is a dead man terreblanch look it s no use tri to be sarcast i hope you will have the good manner suitabl to the occas you have insult the awb say they have no sens you are not awar of the fact the fact are that those men were to be issu with weapon du plessi but they were not terreblanch the fact are look let me finish pleas if you want to engag me in a debat and tri to control me i will refus to respond i have no need to speak with you the fact are that an undertak had been given that weapon would be issu even to the avf men but onli 280 weapon had been made avail at that point now you say no preplan had been done we had done veri good preplan that is whi the awb wa abl to move around occupi the whole white area secur it and defend it after which the defens forc decid that we should all gather at the air forc base where joint plan would be done that wa done becaus i wa in a foreign countri and i accept the right of the gener to decid and evalu the situat and to assembl the men i took my men to the air forc base where we all assembl and pass the night togeth as guest of the bophuthatswana defens forc and offic the follow morn as a result of the interfer of the politician who as mr mangop correctli point out had an entir differ agenda and did not want to stabil bophuthatswana but want to destabil it so that presid mangop s govern could be overthrown so that he could be compel to take part in the elect or so that he could be replac by anoth govern which would take part in the elect the awb onc again gave heed to the wish of the militari author in bophuthatswana du plessi interrupt but you also shot a few of them dead terreblanch that we should withdraw at that stage not a shot had been fire the awb wa inform that they we should withdraw and what did we do we withdrew from the oper area on the instruct of the bophuthatswana polic and colonel breytenbach who almost certainli wa speak on behalf of the bdf we withdrew in vulner vehicl open pick up truck head for the border without our weapon du plessi interrupt but fire as you went terreblanch interrupt wait wait du plessi interrupt were you not terreblanch interrupt you were not there let me tell you du plessi interrupt but is it not true that your men were fire as they went terreblanch of cours it is not true the awb withdrew but i would like to ask you now in all fair if we are to conduct a sensibl discuss pleas do not interrupt me again realli don t the awb reach a certain point and that wa a bridg the first vehicl had alreadi cross over and the second vehicl the command vehicl in which my gener were travel an ordinari pickup peopl arm with handgun hunt rifl and other weapon not oper weapon right at the bridg the veri same defens forc which wa suppos to defend us suddenli start fire on our move vehicl with 40 mm mortar and that is it the awb took cover and fire back the fight start and they took their injur took them out includ colonel bouwer and the other six injur men who are now in the hospit these injur peopl were put in the open pick up and fire as they went and as you said reach the border the casualti figur as you said reach 50 dead on the side of the bophuthatswana peopl includ 10 civilian which i sincer regret i believ they were caught in the crossfir no one will accept respons as to whose bullet hit them but more than 280 peopl accord to the sabc south african broadcast corpor were injur our movement wa place in a posit where we had to defend ourselv battersbi interrupt but where wa your victori then your shine victori terreblanch wait a moment wait battersbi interrupt i want to ask you about the shine victori that you refer to today at the press confer in ventersdorp in fact it is the direct opposit of what the overwhelm major of south african and foreign believ i want you to tell us how it is possibl that you can speak of an overwhelm victori and a miracl when in the first place your men were thrown out by the avf s peopl second your peopl your soldier were shot at by the secur forc of a govern which in your own word had invit you into the countri third it wa clear that you stood no chanc against the unit forc of the sadf south african defens forc how can that be a victori i cannot understand it terreblanch i want you to understand it veri clearli so that you will not remain in the dark for so long it is a shine victori when peopl are sent into an oper area with handgun they were fire upon from casspir armor vehicl and other armor vehicl they were fire upon in open pick up and even ordinari sedan they stop the assault of the mortar and the casspir by fire back effect they move up to the border and the outcom of the attack wa just that the total number of casualti on the side of the awb five were kill while on the other side 50 were kill and 285 were paus now i want to say to you the reason whi du preez interrupt were they the enemi terreblanch but of cours what do you call the peopl who are fire on you with mortar du preez but they were the legitim defens forc and you see them as the enemi terreblanch look everyon know that the defens forc and the polic had turn against the bophuthatswana govern they mutini that is whi presid mangop is where he is today and your enemi becom your enemi within a second that is what we found out there those who were suppos to be our friend the communist inspir element within the defens forc let me say straight out that wa the dilemma mani of the bdf member welcom the awb in the most friendli manner the betray which wa commit wa so shock precis becaus it came from the same forc which had receiv us in such a friendli manner the desert in mr mangop s defens forc and the polic desert paus gener turner told us that night that 90 percent of hi policemen had desert the next morn the whole bophuthatswana polic forc desert so the awb drew the fire of the polic and defens forc desert who were use artilleri and armor vehicl against it small arm fire and you say you find it difficult to see it as a victori had the awb not been abl to stop the armor vehicl in their retreat it would have meant hundr of dead in the awb but that did not happen battersbi i understand that but i want to ask again how can it be a shine victori when you yourself withdrew from the scene know full well as you said today that gen viljoen had betray you sever time how could you terreblanch interrupt it remain a victori for us becaus we pull out as we had been ask to do by the bdf we follow the instruct of the head of state whom we recogn as the head of state we did not know that at that stage he wa no longer head of state if the head of state and hi forc say we must withdraw and we do it and we withdraw honor and we are attack dure our withdraw and we fight our way out and we fight to gain safeti and we fight and we win can you still say you can t understand how that can be a victori i am a veteran i serv a long time in rhodesia for year i serv on the south west african border i know battl under those circumst the most difficult battl is when you are withdraw when you are in fact fire over your shoulder and if you are drawn into an ambush four or five time and you emerg from the presenc of death and you bring your peopl home and your casualti figur is so small that in our group onli three men fell with two more later when gen viljoen sent out some men in all that great convoy onli three men fell and you tell me that is not a success battersbi but i want to ask you onc again how can that be a victori when you left your own injur peopl behind du plessi interrupt and the presid you had gone to defend wa no longer presid battersbi how can that be a victori mr terreblanch terreblanch look those are two question there are two of you ask question so pleas listen patient to my repli the two repli du preez could you keep it short our time is limit terreblanch look i want to answer you the way you ought to be answer du preez mr rowan cronj is on the telephon he would like to respond to some of the thing you have said terreblanch he s welcom i first wish to say i see it as a shine victori for peopl who had to withdraw under fire and onli left three bodi behind while the attack who had laid the ambush suffer a loss of more than 50 dead and more than 280 injur and bear in mind that we pick up our injur except for the three whom we had not seen in the convoy inde we had to search for their bodi where they had fallen i can assur you had they been left behind by the awb i would have institut an investig du preez i think you will have to here we have a report by a senior avf man tim do you have it du plessi ye an avf man said i could hear clearli over the radio how he wa order hi men not to turn back for the injur they would not stand a chanc against the bdf soldier terreblanch let me first ask you who is the person who said that du plessi it wa a senior member of the avf who wa involv in the terreblanch interrupt i ask what hi name wa my name if eugen terreblanch you are tim who is the person who made thi so call alleg whi is he not here on agenda tonight i do not react to ghost basson i would also like to enter thi discuss max du preez pleas ye i have been neglect you a littl basson i would like us to look at the other side of thi issu and i would like to hear mr terreblanch s comment on the role play by the sadf in the whole matter we are face with an absolut textbook type communist takeov where chao and anarchi is first be creat du preez interrupt is that a statement or is that a question to mr terreblanch basson it is a question to mr terreblanch du preez mr terreblanch terreblanch i would realli like to answer the question but let him tell me what he want from me give him the opportun du preez we just have a few minut left pleas i would rather like to hear from you now that the question ha been pose basson in other word we would like to know what role paus now that the revolut ha been complet after the awb and the volksfront have withdrawn the south african defens forc came into the pictur for the first time and if one look at a document distribut by joe slovo in which he also predict what the situat will be like in south africa he said quotat in english these action on the part of element within the regim extend for exampl to the continu disrupt action aim by the regim s nation intellig servic against the conserv parti and inkatha as well as element within the south african militari establish du preez interrupt jakki excus me we realli do not have time terreblanch i will answer as quickli as possibl du preez thank you terreblanch it seem clear to me that the order paus after an agreement had been reach for us to becom part of the joint civilian forc there then i wa ask at 0430 by rowan cronj via gen turner to leav the territori becaus if i did not leav the territori accord to him the sadf would act i left the territori becaus i expect thi and i did not want to take respons for thi i left the territori as request the awb left the territori you are complet correct in say thi the volksfront left the area and still the sadf took action the defens forc tri to find a reason to overthrow presid mangop attempt blame us the defens forc went into the territori not to stabil it wa there and it know if anyon wa not invit it is the sadf presid mangop said repeatedli he did not
