by a larg number of afghan arab and began to includ veri gradual extremist fundamentalist group from sever arab and islam countri whose activ and distribut were prepar and coordin to be a major financi resourc for pan fundament and so thi network aim at europ through iran and thenc to turkey and bulgaria from there they divid up among the countri of the former eastern bloc and western europ especi holland germani franc and itali french statist show that 70 percent of the heroin come from afghanistan pakistan and iran with the collaps of the soviet union the golden crescent network expand into these new countri and cooper with the republ of central asia which in recent time have experienc an explos in the cultiv of drug with the cooper of the golden crescent s expert h5 cooper with the mafia h5 intern report confirm that the global fundamentalist drug network ha succeed in penetr market by close cooper with the intern mafia that have histor control them agreement were sign with the famou sicilian cosa nostra with mani russian mafia and the local mafia in most countri thi cooper with intern mafia led to drug for arm deal that play an import role in facilit the deliveri of all type of arm to extremist religi movement in most countri the local network introduc the extremist to secret and formerli unknown rout through which they are abl to infiltr thi or that countri and which also suppli them with secret refug to which to escap from the pursuit of secur men the interpol report recent reveal that a few month ago network for smuggl drug from from the golden crescent have made inroad into the dark contin which ha not been known for consum drug accord to thi inform the african network use zanzibar and mombasa kenya as it two rout into east and west africa a number of arab and african secur report indic that thi network belong to the fundamentalist network these market were open to fund the extremist islam movement activ in africa which are base in sudan even more danger is the fact that the global fundamentalist fund network doe not confin it activ to wholesal but focus on control the drug traffick market with half wholesal and retail numer secur bureau in western europ meet in thi phenomenon which wa recent discov while follow and intens monitor the movement of the extremist islam network in some european countri french intellig discov that drug traffick play a major role in fund algerian fi cell and those of the tunisian ennahdah movement on it soil they saw that there are complex and close coordin and organ network control by tunisian and algerian they have their own pakistani suppli network special in smuggl heroin into europ through iran the french secur agenc had previous discov in investig the background of the social and athlet club control by fundamentalist and pursu drug dealer that the true aim wa not protect arab and muslim immigr from thi plagu but control the market the agenc notic that some fi member and some of the north african fundamentalist who sell smuggl and stolen good in the thiev market in pari soon turn to sell drug as it give them a bigger profit thu the share taken out to fund the algerian fundamentalist is bigger in germani belgium and holland the turkish network link to the fundamentalist network is in control in most of the other european countri thi phenomenon ha been clearli notic recent without secur agenc be abl alway to determin the link between the drug dealer and fundamentalist extremist h5 hekmatyar the new leader h5 some report go so far as to speak of a highli organ and prepar global fundamentalist network assign the task of all stage from drug smuggl to distribut by way of barter them for arm and smuggl them to network special in money launder in sever foreign bank in the caribbean island the british isl europ and some countri of latin america as well as bank in lo angel montreal luxembourg switzerland itali hungari poland and russia the inform add that everi major fundamentalist movement activ today in thi or that arab or islam countri ha a repres in charg of fund oper secur money and arm and link to the leadership of thi global network in the area under hekmatyar s influenc in afghanistan it appear that thi network ha been abl to attract more islam faction than iran especi those that declin to announc their obedi to the islam republ prefer to maintain their independ and their ideolog oppos to shiit fundamentalist hegemoni for thi reason expert today agre that the primari leader of the new pan islam is not khamen i nor even hasan al turabi but golboddin hekmatyar the main overs of the drug trade in the golden crescent and henc the main backer and maestro of the extremist fundamentalist movement in the view of these expert the reason that leader of the global islam movement flock to afghanistan like hasan al turabi rachid ghannouchi and other is to coordin with the new leader and seek hi favor observ say that the recent war hekmatyar wage against the group of presid rabbani and ahmad shah ma ud with the cooper of former american as publish communist dostam wa part of hi new plan to take power in afghanistan and proclaim it an islam republ and the main base and refug for extremist fundamentalist movement for year hekmatyar s region ha been a refug for the afghan arab and extremist flee their countri sinc benazir bhutto assum power in pakistan and announc her intent to expel the afghan arab from peshawar jalalabad ha becom the major altern sanctuari for the afghan and extremist a gather center for their leader such as egyptian shawqi al islambuli and algerian kamreddin kherban and abdallah ana and the major plan and fund site for terrorist oper in the arab and islam countri it is noteworthi that some religi group tri in the begin to critic islamist for resort to thi method of fund especi as drug are prohibit in islam not onli their sale but their cultiv product consumpt and storag so much for the al turabi hekmatyar theori which ha spread through the rank of the fundamentalist that justifi thi trade on the basi of wage war against the west and the strategi of fragment it societi thi is what is gener claim by some islam drug dealer in the street of pari rome or bonn they say that they sell onli to white more danger is that the promot of thi trade on a wide scale ha led to the transform of third world countri among them islam countri from produc to consum countri it is noteworthi that afghanistan and pakistan have both becom big consum of drug as well as other islam and arab countri that have recent experienc an increas in drug smuggl activ there wa also a strategi to corrupt arab and muslim societi it ha alreadi reach the point where some leader of islam group have issu religi rule legitim drug smuggl and use as a mean of mobil fighter to undertak suicid oper thi wa seen in the lebanes war but with the militia of all side now it is seen in the suicid oper of some extremist in algeria where more than one report ha reveal the fact that fighter were addict to drug befor they took on danger attack in ani case drug traffick is not the onli forbidden sin commit by the extremist it seem that the call of shaykh abdelbaki sahraoui imam of the khalid ibn walid mosqu in pari and co founder of fi fell on deaf ear when he attack those islamist in a sermon and ask them to stop traffick in smuggl good he reaffirm that thi wa illegitim and forbidden they would be better off sell flower as one muslim clergyman said is it not also forbidden for a muslim to kill hi muslim brother but it appear that the extremist fundamentalist new logic is that the end justifi the mean the mean that they recent use secur them fund that is compar to the budget of some rich countri that is more import to them even if they undertak the biggest defam of the imag of islam by build mafia style smuggl network hide behind islam valu without ani of their member dare to oppos or question the health of their call or their credibl
