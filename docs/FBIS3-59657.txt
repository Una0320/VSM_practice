although later run test proceed base on the condit defin for the mlu001 manufactur in 1980 in order to develop vehicl for use on the yamanashi test track new test vehicl were need to perform variou test and verif therefor construct began on a new mlu002n test vehicl thi vehicl wa complet at the end of last year and ha been avail for run test sinc the end of januari h5 basic specif of the mlu002n h5 the follow two propos were consid as the design object for the new test vehicl 1 with the premis of restor the burn mlu002 to it origin state the onli major revis in the specif are measur for fire 2 the design is complet redon when possibl pre check of the vehicl for the yamanashi test track is includ in the specif revis although propos 2 wa desir the design and manufactur period were extrem short and an earli start of full scale test at the miyazaki test track wa import as a result we proceed with the design base on propos 1 where restor to the origin state wa critic from the manufactur period in 1987 to the time of the fire improv lead to signific chang in the structur of the car and the superconduct magnet the tabl compar the specif of mlu002n s main featur mlu002n specifica tion

the design goal wa the 420 km h to achiev thi speed on the 7 km long miyazaki test track requir a highli reliabl drive system of power suppli equip surfac coil and superconduct magnet even the car fulfil the necessari condit of a reliabl independ brake system in the car and a lighter weight the weight of the car wa increas by the fire measur to a final weight of 20 ton it wa clearli shown that remov some of the equip and part dure the high speed run test lessen the weight air brake that are not affect by the quench of the superconduct magnet or problem in the power suppli system were formal adopt as the independ brake use on the car for emerg oper by have the brake disc project from the car bodi air drag is increas to obtain brake power howev when simpler and lighter construct are consid the design wa limit to the direct use as a result even in the extrem condit of no regen brake quench from half of the superconduct magnet and one non work air brake the run curv for the high speed run on the test track is provid with a coil short circuit gener brake interv at the termin stop calcul show that stop from 420 km h will be possibl h5 the chassi and the car h5 base on the investig into the caus of the car fire on the mlu002 a varieti of measur were implement for fire resist and noncombust the current cross section shape of the chassi and the front shape are ident to those of the mlu002 howev the front of the structur wa chang to an aluminum alloy made from carbon fiber reinforc plastic cfrp and the front window wa elimin the materi use insid the car were noncombust or fire resist passeng facil like interior furnish light and air condit were the minimum requir for the test the car s interior wa partit into three section onli the central section which is the instrument room is surround by magnet shield plate seat space for 12 peopl is maintain but test are be perform without ani seat instal the car ha differ structur for the miyazaki a car and the hyuga b car car b ha the same basic design of the car at the time of the fire and use a link superconduct magnet elast suspens method car a use the newli design superconduct magnet elast suspens method for the two car frame sinc both car oper under the condit of oppos levit section mix with sidewal levit section in the miyazaki test track restrict are place on the car and the construct and elast suspens cannot normal be use consequ the elast suspens mechan for the superconduct magnet is usual suppress and test are perform in a constant state elast suspens is onli activ to test the elast suspens method the extens amount of the support leg and accompani car height were correct to the standard design valu in the convent oppos levit method the superconduct magnet that have the same specif as those in the revis mlu002 model were design to have low current densiti the air condit system instal in car a use the claud process and that in car b use the sterl process sinc the batteri ha capac to oper onli one car from the power sourc in the car oper the car s air condition a lighter weight is design by oper onli one side dure the run test the abov diagram not includ show the exterior of the car h5 conclus h5 immedi befor japan nation railway wa broken up and privat the mlu002 that had been nurtur under the guidanc of the railway technic research institut wa weak by natur nevertheless we persev as a result expect are increas but difficult problem concern the real abil are troublesom at last we are quickli approach the final phase given the priceless instruct receiv from the mlu002 the initi design that wa the respons of the railway technic research institut and the intens scrutini the mlu002n wa born although i believ a varieti of problem will be encount in the futur i would like to see them dealt with serious
