languag f p 105 japanes f articl type cso text the japan atom power compani and the central research institut of electr power industri criepi naoshi yoda director start joint research with the u s depart of energi on metal fuel as the futur fuel for fbr present day fbr use mix oxid fuel that is ceram but switch to metal fuel will serv to increas thermal effici and make reprocess easier metal fuel is an alloy of uranium plutonium and zirconium becaus metal fuel like mix oxid fuel doe not contain oxygen it heat transfer rate is good metal fuel can effici suppli heat to the coolant materi sodium without rais the temperatur of part of the reactor core that make possibl smaller fbr with the same output as larger fbr that use mix oxid fuel in addit the natur of the nuclear reaction is such that when the temperatur of the fuel rise the nuclear reaction is inhibit so metal fuel ha anoth strong point in that the inhibitori effect increas if the heat transfer rate is good after it is burn the metal fuel melt then electr is pass through it to make it adher to electrod so that the plutonium and uranium can be recov the process of dissolv the fuel in nitric acid as perform with mix oxid fuel is not necessari and dri reprocess can be done metal fuel had not been practic in the past becaus ga wa gener when the fuel wa heat caus it to swell up and break easili mix oxid fuel is ceram with mani small gap so the ga can escap and there is no worri about the fuel break although the problem can be circumv by creat small gap between the insid of the metal fuel and it clad tube that wa not practic becaus the thermal effici drop the japan atom power co criepi and the u s doe solv both the problem of the thermal expans and the drop in thermal effici by fill up the space between the metal fuel and the clad tube with sodium next they will look into core design that are suitabl for metal fuel sinc 1964 the u s doe ha been conduct research on metal fuel at an fbr in idaho the ebr ii output 20 000 kw japan wait until next year for the first critic of the monju fbr which use mix oxid fuel japan will also move forward with research on metal fuel the next gener fuel
