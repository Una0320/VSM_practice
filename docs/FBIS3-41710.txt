languag f p 105 russian f articl type cso f p 106 articl by cand biol sci yelena mikhaylovna vlasikhina f equal to aid if not more frighten text today scientist are alreadi absolut sure of the exist of 7 seven hepat virus infect man and strike hi most import organ the liver the diseas aris in thi case take mani form hepat cirrhosi and primari cancer of the liver it seem as if we can no longer amaz or frighten our peopl by anyth but thi at the infect hospit the hepat and viral diseas depart those who wind up here can now recal with a doctor s help how and where they becam infect i wa work as a dental hygienist said an attract young woman an elderli woman bitterli recal undergo a cours of acupunctur a few month ago and then there wa anoth a quit one in the corner of the ward who had recent visit israel as a guest and now let s move on to the pediatr clinic the gastroenterolog depart children with a terribl diagnosi cirrhosi of the liver are treat here and most know that thi diseas is the punish suffer by alcohol sometim it is hard for the doctor to figur out how thi diseas came about the mother of an 11 year old boy her eye sunken from sleepless night no longer abl to shed tear explain the boy fell ill after a routin immun botkin s diseas wa the diagnosi he recov but he still feel poorli sometim now the sentenc ha been hand down a year and a half to live noth can be done the doctor are powerless now that the diseas ha come into it own but could anyth have been done sooner ye that s what thi articl is about viral hepat is a diseas that occur extens throughout the entir world up to 250 000 case are regist annual in our countri these are onli the acut and obviou case of infect while in fact it is believ that thi figur is underst by a factor of 10 perhap onli acut respiratori diseas afflict peopl more often and as for the number of fatal and complic there are no equal to thi infect medic worker of the develop countri in which the fight against viral hepat ha been rais to the rank of a state program came to understand thi long ago reli on laboratori test medic worker can distinguish hepat today into type a the dirti hand diseas and type b so call serum hepat five other variant are not recogn by russian statist and they are classifi by a process of elimin as a mix group neither a nor b in russia hepat a is encount more often than the other type make up 60 70 percent of all hepat case in adult and 70 80 percent in children as with ani other intestin infect hepat a is typifi by season occurr and so it is now in fall that epidemiologist are note an increas in morbid especi among children attend nurseri school and schoolchildren mani probabl recal that gamma globulin immun use to be given against jaundic in time of mass outbreak today thi is hardli possibl it s expens and the prepar is not avail in suffici quantiti how do we protect ourselv the advic is simpl wash your hand more frequent don t eat unwash food don t drink water from unfamiliar sourc and it would be better to boil all drink water and if you happen to make contact with a person who ha the diseas be on guard for 5 week medic worker advis caution to tourist to develop countri of asia and africa thi infect is extrem widespread there and most of the popul suffer the diseas in earli childhood western tourist make an effort to immun themselv against hepat a there is a specif vaccin alreadi and clinic test have proven it to be highli effect such a prepar ha also been develop in russia it studi ha just begun and therefor we need to follow the rule that save the drown is a matter for the drown themselv and thi is in fact possibl the scandinavian countri where the hepat a is an extrem rare phenomenon are an exampl of thi isol case for everi 100 000 popul for comparison the figur is up to 100 in certain region of our countri at least anoth two type of hepat are transmit by dirti hand hepat e ha now been studi suffici well thi type occur most often in develop countri russian are absolut defenseless befor it and it cours is much more seriou than that of hepat a vaccin against thi infect are not even avail yet abroad and therefor the sole defens is to observ the rule of person and social hygien and now let s talk about the form of hepat for which blood is the gateway in the earli 1960 the american scientist blamberg discov a characterist serum protein of hepat viru for which he wa subsequ award the nobel prize sinc that time a real possibl ha appear for doctor to distinguish between onli two type of hepat by blood test a and b detect of a protein antigen specif to hepat b in blood made it possibl to use thi marker to determin the extent of blood infect modern test method are so sensit that they can detect a quantiti of viru of less than 1 gm in a billion trial thi quantiti of viru by the way is fulli suffici to caus diseas for thi the viru need to find the slightest break in the skin or mucou membran of the recipi enter the blood through it and then reach the liver with it flow the liver is the onli place in the human bodi where hepat b viru can multipli infect person react various to what happen in the liver as a result total differ cours appear viru carrier acut infect chronic hepat cirrhosi and cancer of the liver it is not at all necessari for jaundic to accompani acut hepat b medic worker note that the begin of diseas can recal the pattern of intestin infect and even ear nose and throat diseas especi among children the main thing is that the liver is enlarg which is someth you have to know how to detect a diagnosi as to precis what type of hepat is present can be establish onli after a number of special laboratori test to prevent infect of patient receiv transfus of blood plasma it prepar and compon all blood procur from donor must be test mandatorili such test have been conduct in our countri for 20 year alreadi but for some reason post transfus hepat continu to be a frequent phenomenon could it be becaus the blood servic ha been use test of veri low sensit in develop countri where a veri seriou effort ha now been made for over 10 year to test blood for hepat b it proport in the structur of hepat after blood transfus ha been reduc to 10 percent nineti percent of hepat is associ there with infect by yet anoth viru hepat c thi viru resist detect for a long time and what is interest is that the test for thi infect wa develop befor the agent itself wa describ in 1989 a check of donor in mani countri of the world reveal that a signific part of the world s popul is afflict with hepat c what rais concern is the fact that presenc of infect can be judg onli indirectli for the moment by reveal antibodi to the viru as for exampl in the case of aid and syphili which significantli reduc the true number of infect individu today most develop and develop countri have introduc mandatori test of blood for hepat c into their blood servic thi isn t as success of cours as in the case of hepat b nonetheless today thi is the onli mean of prevent post transfus hepat c it may be said that blood is not yet be test for thi infect in our countri if hepat is so widespread it is fulli logic to suppos that it is transmit not onli by donat blood but also by other pathway in fact hepat b is astound in the divers of the mean by which the bodi is infect children fate to be born from mother who are carrier of the infect or who contract the diseas dure pregnanc and not necessarili in it jaundic form fall into the risk group thi is whi hepat b test of pregnant women is mandatori in mani countri hepat b is transmit sexual the viru is detect in sperm and in vagin secret a special risk group ha been determin prostitut who are breed ground of infect unfortun there are few who know that hepat b is even categor as a vener diseas for thi reason the slightest break in a partner s mucou membran is enough for the viru to get into the blood these two pathway vertic from mother to child and horizont sexual perhap domin in variou develop countri in which it is believ that over 20 percent of the popul is infect it ha been note that entir famili may be infect with hepat b viru we know of one moscow famili in which a newborn infant contract the diseas in the hospit the mother wa then infect from the child dure breast feed and final the father of the child manag to catch the diseas from the mother neither the sexual nor the vertic pathway of infect is typic of hepat c but as with hepat b thi diseas is transmit through close person commun when the elementari rule of hygien are not observ virus may be transmit from one to anoth by share comb manicur and pedicur instrument and tattoo tool still the greatest percentag of infect occur in therapeut institut medic worker are especi at risk select test of medic personnel reveal particular hepat b marker five time more frequent that in donat blood sever case of acut hepat are note everi year in almost everi larg clinic in which case fatal have been known they have all been the result of job relat infect medic worker who come in contact with blood daili are at the greatest risk surgeon surgic and procedur nurs and specialist in procur and test the blood of donor and patient hepat b and c infect may spread within a hospit if diagnost and therapeut procedur that invad the skin and mucou membran are carri out with reusabl and poorli clean instrument among patient those who receiv poorli test blood on the basi of vital indic carri the greatest risk of fall ill thi is well known to medic worker but they are powerless if materi support to the use of high qualiti blood test is insuffici are there realli no other way of stop hepat b and c besid blood test in 30 year of scientif research in thi field some thing have alreadi been accomplish creation of a specif vaccin against hepat b is the greatest accomplish when scientist report thi the press wrote triumphantli that the first vaccin against cancer had been develop hepat b vaccin have been avail for over 12 year alreadi dure which time hundr of million of the planet s inhabit have been immun it ha been demonstr that the vaccin cours can provid defens against the viru for 7 or more year unfortun you can t get immun anywher in russia today either free of charg or for money the domest made prepar ha not yet been perfect for practic use foreign prepar are not be purchas although western firm have alreadi been produc second gener vaccin that is absolut safe and effect for a long time medic worker and newborn infant from mother who are carrier of the viru are mandatorili immun in most develop countri but even where the epidemiolog situat is recogn to be unfavor there are sever such region in russia hepat b vaccin is includ on the calendar of children s immun respond to a propos by the world health organ a number of african countri and itali have begun implement a program of expand immun of the popul it is disappoint to learn of such accomplish that are inaccess to russia thi is whi moscow s scientist and medic worker have join togeth to establish the hepat control assist fund a public organ bring togeth all who desir to join in the struggl use the resourc of modern accomplish in the epidemiolog prevent diagnosi and treatment of viral diseas of the liver the gap today between what ha been accomplish through world progress in the area of hepat and what russian practic health ha avail to it today is rather larg the fund ha develop the anti hepat program and we invit all who wish to do so to work with us to carri it out the fund alreadi ha a possibl for test donat blood in the way it is done in america and europ we also have hepat b vaccin in moscow we can be reach by telephon at 490 1414 and 365 8998
