a modern social democraci a normal parliamentari life excerpt h5 human right an end of centuri religion h5 pavelescu mr presid do you believ that the world should know more about one of the most import peopl in the leadership of thi countri nastas to tell you the truth for quit some time now i have not been approach with such question as what have you done in the past four year still if you wish to know more about me i am readi to tell you i wa born in bucharest on 22 june 1950 under the sign of cancer a terribl sign for those who choos polit for their field of activ passag omit pavelescu now i will approach you in your capac as presid of the pdsr social democraci parti of romania recent you have embark fulli on the activ of organ thi polit format you have paid visit in provinc and attend symposium all thi lead to the impend question peopl said of your parti that it wa establish instantan around the presid of romania ion iliescu whose immens prestig permit the parti to achiev stabil veri quickli on a somehow sentiment basi what is left of the initi feel and what are the current goal nastas certainli there is still immens sympathi for mr ion iliescu who ha assum the respons to pull romania out of the crisi and certain peopl not abl to discredit him resort to the uncivil mean of insult onli a person who possess such qualiti as the head of our state democrat through hi entir structur toler and conciliatori can continu untouch by these ignobl attack but sinc you have refer to the parti and it destini i will give you a frank answer no polit format can surviv if it doe not construct it structur and activ on modern base after the decemb 1989 revolut some associ were set up that were mostli against rather than in favor of someth the fsn nation salvat front itself wa against the past super central dictatorship in the economi suffoc in polit like a hous that ha not been air for a long time and which the rejuven flow of life ha not penetr the civic allianc wa establish in the same way thi is to give you just two exampl all these structur can no longer resist the new condit as far as we are concern the chang of name that took place at our parti s last congress from fdsn democrat nation salvat front into pdsr social democraci parti of romania wa not onli a formal modif but it wa conceiv as a fundament chang in our way of think and in our action we wish to establish an intellig parti that ha it own messag to promot h5 we have an econom concept that is capabl of inspir h5 dynam and effici in our societi pavelescu now we are go to talk about a sensit area name about idea on what doctrin do you base your activ nastas it is definit the modern social democrat doctrin that so mani social democrat parti in europ and in the world follow it ha been emphat state that social democraci doe not have it own concept in the econom area thi is a complet fals idea in europ at least social democraci ha form it own school of manag and ha expert capabl of confer dynam to econom life and inspir the motiv forc that is necessari in our centuri one should not assign a pure social compon to social democraci thi would look as if in the same societi there were two model of societi one for product and anoth one for distribut of product thi could be compar to a car with two engin and two steer wheel thi is absurd we have one singl concept which we could call an integr one which is capabl of incorpor the econom manageri and social human progress in one and the same vision in fact we defin more precis the relationship between individu and the product sphere likewis we have an individu concept about econom area or sector and about the area of product and servic the way in which we regard thing allow us to introduc new individu element in our social econom life and not element borrow from abroad passag omit pavelescu thu could we assum that the pdsr view itself as a parti which through it program and it activ constantli wish to ensur the econom and social modern of the countri in order to elimin the remnant of the excess central of the past and to creat new sourc of dynam in both area nastas thi could be a good definit for a continu chang realiti pavelescu but what are we go to do about those who disput all thi they continu to accus you of everi possibl sin or charg you with the most extravag intent nastas we have live too long in the atmospher of clash between social and capit thu we got use to answer question about the futur onli with term creat in thi confront but thi seem to me to be a simplist and incorrect attitud social ha an emot impact on fewer and fewer peopl on the other hand capit still seem to us permeat with too mani neg connot at the polit and social level for it to repres the miracul key or the magic word with a strong magnet forc through our ideolog we have found solut for the better organ of relat between individu and societi thi is the essenc of our concept how do we regard thi relationship we cannot formul it correctli without also refer to the role of the state we believ that at least for the transit period the state ha an import role to play we cannot pretend that all that is happen in the area of product relat doe not concern us pavelescu at a symposium organ at poiana brasov mr mircea cosea chairman of the council for coordin strategi and econom reform made a speech in which he drew attent to the fact that the concept of the market economi must be appli in such a way that the ordinari individu should regard it as a necess wa he speak on behalf of the pdsr nastas thi is a rhetor question certainli mr cosea includ in hi idea the parti whose member he is at the same time refer to the market economi as if we had a choic is wrong the market economi ha been implement all around us we cannot stay isol it would be as if we were to choos anoth rail gaug for our engin thi is inconceiv the problem howev is that we should work in a way that could make peopl perceiv other effect not onli the neg effect of thi economi such as the increas of price inflat and unemploy h5 optim condit for competit for contest h5 pavelescu do you have a solut nastas there are solut i wa not the one who invent them optim condit must be creat for econom competit we should elimin monopoli that gener high and disproportion price bureaucraci and corrupt howev we can see a viciou circl here we need restructur and financi sourc to permit the develop of industri and they in turn can establish the framework for the oper of the law of competit thi is our understand of the way in which we can emerg from the current impass and we have to do it alon nobodi will work for us passag omit pavelescu mr presid how do you explain that while you remain a parti that is close connect with the 1989 decemb revolut thu not mark by the defect of the past your influenc in univers is still poor nastas there is a veri simpl explan for thi certain univers teacher who were also part of the old structur have repaint their past have bluf and continu to bluff and attract student thi situat is anomal student all over the world are basic left orient onli in our countri have the student opinion deviat pavelescu and god forbid that a basic right wing concept should penetr the student world nastas you are right we are tri to get closer to thi section basic their interest are close connect with those that we are fight for we are go to establish a youth forum the univers group will play an import role in thi forum pavelescu consid that your is such a young parti you have not had time to take care of other import social strata of the elector whi for exampl should so mani women vote for the pd fsn democrat parti nation salvat front when as a matter of fact that parti ha brought them onli disappoint nastas i believ that in principl our viewpoint come quit close we intend to organ a pdsr women s associ in gener term due to past frustrat and due to our neglig i have to be frank here the proport of women in the structur of our leadership is insignific by all mean we will correct thi mistak and you will see that the number of women readi to join us will increas the day when peopl vote on the basi of feel are gone thi is certain pavelescu what type of organiz formula have you adopt nastas those that are includ in our statut local organ coordin council the execut bureau and the stand deleg we continu follow aspect that are gradual becom our distinct featur represent and democraci h5 the pdsr ha becom and will remain a polit forc h5 pavelescu therefor can one say that the pdsr ha becom a power forc nastas one can say that whi not and it will continu to grow stronger we need a few month to organ our strategi we will increas our activ in the provinc in the come period mr oliviu gherman pdsr presid and other member of the parti leadership will particip in activ that are aim at enhanc the organ of our branch in the provinc will hold theoret debat with a practic charact and will dissemin our precis messag pavelescu thu those who consid the pdsr a parti of pedant are mistaken nastas they are utterli mistaken we are a milit parti if thi characterist doe not take concret shape in what mihai eminescu romanian poet call ugli street scene it is becaus we detest the idea of turn the street into a place where polit disput are solv howev those who mistak our good manner for weak are wrong what is new and noteworthi in our activ is the combin of joint action with the particip of parti cadr and consid that we are the rule parti with the member of the execut thi fact is benefici for two reason the fsn made a mistak in leav the govern in charg of dialogu on all issu after the may 1990 elect the parti felt in a way neglect we wish to make good thi error therefor we approach the local parti organ with group of peopl that includ both member of the parti and of the execut the govern member can onli gain from see everyth on the spot the member of the parti leadership can also onli gain when they take over a part of the respons pavelescu a modern parti with a clear messag and with viabl structur thu a parti that is constantli increas it mobil forc is thi the way you want to appear in the eye of the public nastas thi is more or less what we are and thi is definit what we want to becom h5 we tri to find way for cooper with all polit h5 forc in the parliament pavelescu i am go to approach you now in your capac as presid of the chamber of deputi of the romanian parliament is it onli our impress or are you realli annoy with the chamber nastas annoy might be a littl too strong an express dissatisfi ye and i have reason to be an atmospher that is at varianc with the rule for a proper function of such an institut ha been establish in the chamber of deputi there are deputi who are absent without ani reason other ask their friend to sign the attend book for them therefor often we do not have the necessari number of deputi to adopt certain law howev i have to tell you someth els if you ask ani presid of a chamber of deputi you will see that they have the same reason for discont a parliament often look like an undisciplin structur a machin that is work to no avail howev a veri import aspect can be overlook we at the level of parliament absorb a great amount of tension which would otherwis overflow the street with consequ that would be difficult to estim pavelescu i am not conceal the impress that a part of the public perceiv thing a littl differ the impress exist that we are wit two type of blockag an econom and a legisl blockag which fuel each other what is your view on thi issu nastas thi is an exagger you should not forget that the parliament is also a sort of mirror of the nation s wish it symbol if the nation had want a parliament in which the pdsr held 51 percent of the deputi and senat the nation would have act accordingli but the nation chose the current situat and we have to respect it will passag omit pavelescu you have initi a dialogu in which willingli or unwillingli virtual all polit forc repres the parliamentari spectrum particip are you pleas with it nastas do you want a sincer answer we believ that it wa a good idea as a matter of fact dialogu should becom a regular compon of the public life in romania it is sad that some peopl consid it as an except case we tri to carri out a certain inter parti exercis of democraci becaus apart from our option we are also duti bound to cooper in order to reach our well defin goal and stop what use to be call the cold war after the elect pavelescu have you had ani result so far nastas i believ so for exampl we succeed in chang at least our way of approach other therefor when mr dinu patriciu promin leader of the liber parti 93 so rude attack the entir pdsr it wa easi for us to isol him to turn it into an exampl and not a rule and pleas note that we have not identifi for a moment the whole liber parti 93 with the respect deputi in ani event we will not hold talk with him befor he apolog howev the dialogu had except result from anoth aspect it chang the imag of the pdsr the parti that ha been label in everi possibl way ha prove that it ha been accept inde thu the effort wa worthwhil pavelescu the democrat convent of romania cdr accus you of prepar for earli elect to what extent is thi affirm true or fals nastas certain parti for exampl the pd fsn have publicli announc their intent to induc earli elect other parti includ the cdr are prepar for those elect although they are apprehens about the futur in these condit we would be naiv just to stand asid and wait as we have declar we consid thi solut of earli elect as the worst and the most uninspir one it would block us for a while without offer anyth to anybodi in exchang howev if we are face with such an altern we will act accordingli nevertheless i believ that the posit we express publicli wa not properli understood pavelescu what are you refer to nastas i am refer to the need that befor earli gener elect earli local elect should be organ i am say thi becaus a somewhat paradox situat ha been creat at the last local elect we were not a parti therefor among the leader of counti and of bucharest sector mani peopl who are member of the democrat convent or member of the pd fsn were elect it is clear that earli gener elect will be organ with the same compet idea thu the result can alreadi be anticip therefor we are go to propos a modif of the law on public administr and the elector law so that our represent correspond to the proport of the elector that vote for us ani form of action aim at undermin thi procedur will be interpret onli as a measur of arrog egoism just to quot roman pd fsn leader pavelescu mr presid sinc you have been so patient with us we cannot resist the temptat to ask you a question that will probabl seem to you inappropri do you believ that the udmr democrat union of hungarian in romania ha commit itself to obstruct the leadership forev nastas i am go to answer you truth recent in cluj i address thi format and ask them to show a more reason attitud well let me tell you that i receiv a number of posit sign thi mean that your question wa not exactli inappropri
