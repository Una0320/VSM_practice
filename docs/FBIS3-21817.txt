not heed do you continu to think thi way whi arrieta i did not say i wa dissatisfi with the process quit the contrari i said it should be carri out but within certain legal and polit paramet one of them is necessarili the exist of a confess fortun thi is what ha happen and today the attorney gener s offic the offic of the prosecutor gener of the republ and the govern of the republ fulli agre on thi point which ha also been accept by those who are to surrend regard the second point the attorney gener s offic cannot withdraw from the process becaus it particip is determin by the law howev we are think about the possibl of have somebodi who is not the attorney gener the deputi attorney gener attend the preparatori meet becaus it is not desir to deplet our reserv in thi type of situat correspond the govern hint that the prosecutor gener is be naiv in thi process and that the traffick are tri to take advantag of thi situat do you think thi is so arrieta i don t think the prosecutor is act naiv i believ he ha taken an emin jurid posit as correspond to an organ that is part of the judici branch in thi context it is inevit that the drug traffick who have excel legal advis tri to obtain all the benefit and take advantag of the loophol and confus in a crimin law that is confus profus and wordi confront with such a situat we all have the respons of tri to avoid abus to or the improp use of the law the govern ha vast experi on thi issu the experi is base both on the accomplish and the failur of the surrend polici furthermor it handl as correspond to a govern a polit dimens that caus it to be extrem cautiou and sometim bias that is whi it is necessari for us without be naiv or radic to join our knowledg and experi in other word let us forget the la catedr syndrom we have to learn from the past and move forward with respons and without fear correspond you also told el tiempo a month ago that the drug traffick had made no concret offer doe thi still hold true what exactli ha gilberto rodriguez orejuela offer arrieta it is import that the countri s expect regard thi process be lower a few month ago we were told there would be massiv surrend and that drug export would be erad thi natur gener great hope both for the public as well as for the govern unfortun the cali gentlemen chang their posit and today onli talk about the possibl surrend of two person one of them rel minor but the other one gilberto rodriguez of great import becaus of hi hierarchi in the so call cali cartel there is no longer talk about the erad of drug traffick but rather of a possibl cooper that could lead to new surrend or to the gradual reduct of illeg activ all thi is import natur but doe not have the polit or jurid relev that the origin offer had that is whi we should no longer talk about the cali cartel s surrend but about the possibl surrend of gilberto rodriguez that is whi i believ we have to lower expect correspond the discrep between the prosecutor gener and the govern are obviou what is behind their posit will thi situat obstruct the process arrieta discrep of form and substanc between the three institut involv are inevit in a process such as thi becaus the person in charg of the govern the prosecutor s offic and the attorney gener s offic are autonom and will and sometim they have differ opinion about what best suit the countri what is import is that we as respons and sensibl peopl do everyth possibl to reconcil our posit and to work harmoni becaus thi is what suit colombia if thi is not produc then each one will have to perform hi legal and constitut function accord to hi belief of what is best correspond the north american have demand a common posit and thi doe not exist what will happen to the suppli of evid what will happen if they withdraw from the process there is the impress that they are pressur for hardlin solut and that they prefer captur to surrend becaus they do not like the penalti too light that would be impos in the case of surrend what can you tell us about thi arrieta unfortun a tens atmospher in the field of legal cooper ha emerg and we have to overcom it becaus u s cooper is of fundament import but regardless of how import thi cooper might be it cannot be the soul of our polici nor can we depend entir on it becaus legal cooper cannot replac the effort that must be made by our polic which are the one that togeth with the prosecutor gener s offic must gather the necessari evid to prosecut drug traffick about the north american prefer captur to surrend i believ thi is someth all colombian prefer also howev if there is no captur then the second best altern would be the surrend correspond what ha been the posit of the attorney gener s offic on the issu of confess indulg becaus of collabor and hous arrest arrieta my offic ha alway maintain that confess must be a necessari requir and not just ani confess but solid seriou and complet confess in which the peopl and the court author may believ and as a basi for which sentenc can be appli so that they do not engend impun or demor the peopl we have also insist that collabor must be signific specif and percept that there must be a substanti deliveri of asset and that hous arrest would appli onli in except case in minor case correspond it is evid that while the prosecutor gener want the process to move on quickli the govern want to includ element that take into consider nation and intern interest that would make the process move slower how do you think the process should go arrieta thi process ha legal and polit aspect speak in the broadest sens one should not rush becaus we have learn from experi that if thing are rush then error are made i also believ though that we all want the process to move as quickli as reason possibl i think that the prosecutor gener s offic now understand the govern s concern and that the govern now understand the problem of the prosecutor and all of us know now that thi process can move forward onli if an interinstitut effort is made and there is teamwork correspond the role of mediat between the govern and the prosecutor gener s offic ha caus an ambival situat in which the govern accus you of be the uncondit alli of the prosecutor in addit the prosecutor gener s offic argu that your stand is a reflect of that of the govern where do you stand on thi arrieta ye that is all true and if the attorney gener s offic ha tri to mediat it is not onli becaus we believ that posit is one of our duti but becaus we also believ public skirmish weaken institut and undermin the credibl and the trust peopl have in those institut we must not forget that onli crimin fish in these troubl water correspond regard the surrend of the three presum cali cartel member in januari is your predict come true that the ambigu of some articl of the new penal code might creat condit that favor impun in some particular case arrieta i believ so becaus mani of the articl were poorli draft have a confus content and scope and lend themselv to mani interpret for the sake of prevent impun it is necessari that we wed our capabl and effort act in a coordin manner and have the abil to stop ani goal they will undoubtedli tri to score but abov all crimin can onli be sentenc when proof is avail correspond relat to the current controversi what do you think about the remark by the justic minist on the prosecutor gener s offic interpret of articl 369e s scope arrieta the attorney gener s offic respect but doe not complet agre with the justic minist s interpret of articl 369e nor with the implement the prosecutor ha given it by open a formal investig on these proceed it is obviou at least to us that articl 369e is relat to the preced articl that concern the grant of benefit we believ that for articl 369e to be applic those who surrend must confess or collabor either in the proceed pend against them or in new one that are begun as a result of the surrend
