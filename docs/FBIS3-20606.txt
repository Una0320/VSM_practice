world the three gorg power plant should be expand to the largest instal capac allow after take the compens effect of the hydropow station in the upper reach 30 year later it should gener more power for peak shave and reduc it hour of oper to approxim 4 000 individu gener capac should exceed 800 000 kw a total of 24 unit should be instal with a total capac of 19 20 mkw 1 52 mkw higher than that in the valid plan on 3 april 1992 the fifth meet of the seventh plenum of the peopl s congress pass a histor resolut that includ the three gorg project in the 10 year plan for econom and social develop the state council wa author to select the proper time for it implement it approv a valid plan with a normal water level of 175 meter that involv one time construct stage water storag and continu reloc of peopl nevertheless the instal capac of the station requir further investig and discuss h3 1 discuss on instal capac of the three gorg hydropow project h3 the resolut regard the construct of the three gorg project specifi that a total of 26 gener with an individu capac of 680 000 kw will be instal the total instal capac is 17 68 mkw and 84 billion kwh of electr will be gener annual total instal capac is determin by the individu unit capac and number of unit chosen the select of total instal capac howev ha a direct impact on the water energi util effici econom benefit and overal layout of the pivot the annual and monthli flow and the head height of the water at the pivot reservoir capac and it regul behavior determin the overal energi specif instal capac is determin on the basi of the need of the power grid and econom feasibl by use a water util rate instal capac is also a direct function of oper hour per year it should match the total flow pass through all gener up and down the river base on the superior central geograph locat of the three gorg plant and it role in the futur nation power system as well as on the peak shave need of the power grid 10 15 year down the road the three gorg hydropow station is design to oper 4 571 hour per year thi is slightli on the high side in refer to the number of yearli oper hour of station alreadi complet or under construct

4 751 from the tabl 9 out of 12 power station have more equip util hour than that of the three gorg hydropow station about half of them are at approxim 3 500 hour the gezhouba station is appar oper at a high rate for a power station that doe not have much regul capac if the number of hour in oper is reduc to 4 000 per year then an addit 1 20 mkw of capac can be instal and the amount of water discharg can be substanti decreas for thi reason all hydropow plant around the world are expand their capac base on the peak shave requir of the grid thi can not onli enhanc the peak shave effect but can also make full use of avail water resourc to meet season demand without discharg or minim discharg flood water in china in order to improv it peak shave capabl the northeast power grid is plan to expand the fengman station to 1 mkw approxim doubl it in size along thi line of think we are spend billion to construct pump storag power station such as shisan ling guangxu and tianhuang just to solv the peak shave problem premier li peng 2621 7720 clearli point out in the three gorg project construct workshop on 19 novemb that the three gorg project must be construct use mean compat with our socialist market economi and manag with modern techniqu to expand the instal capac of the three gorg project is to offer it tremend peak shave capac to the nation power grid thi is in accord with our socialist market economi that will produc great econom benefit if the tier price structur is expand nationwid it will provid the forc need to enlarg instal capac in hydropow station it also provid a veri promis solut to resolv our peak demand we should total discard the idea that a better hydropow plant is one with long oper hour and high equip util effici accord to an analysi on balanc electr power and energi done by the chang jiang committe dure the plan stage of the project use the year 2015 as the design target the instal capac of the three gorg is 20 40 million kw the correspond water util coeffici is 94 percent and the hour of oper is 4 268 in refer to the overal layout of the three gorg pivot it is better to oper the power plant at approxim 4 000 hour per year the correspond instal capac is 20 21 million kw if it is lower to 3 500 3 000 hour then the correspond instal capac is 24 28 million kw without chang the layout there are two major approach to increas instal capac one is to increas the individu capac and the other is to increas the number of unit we should consid the doubl row layout use in nanchang that adopt the origin russian tokto gul hydropow station design and the lijiaxia hydropow station under construct on the huang he thi compact layout is a better approach to increas the number of instal unit tabl 2 instal capac as a function of reduc oper

peak power to meet the ever rise peak to valley differ in a modern power grid the three gorg is locat at the center of the nation power grid we should buri steel pipe on the south side of the dam to make provis for the construct of a third power station in the futur h3 2 discuss on the select of individu unit capac for the three gorg hydropow station h3 the current plan select a 680 000 kw gener the major advantag is that it can be manufactur domest the disadvantag is that it capac is too low and the total instal capac is also too low the author believ that a gener should be select base on a layout that suit the optim instal capac we should also choos a plan that employ the most technolog advanc econom feasibl unit that would maxim the total instal capac we are build the largest hydropow plant in the world and we are plan to instal unit at the level of the 1970 moreov it is even lower than the individu capac at the grand coule and itaipu thi is way out of the ordinari we are stress the fact that we want to be self suffici we need to liber our think and chang our concept the select of individu unit capac need to be revalid base on a socialist market economi gener that are go to be instal over a dozen year down the road ought to be a product of the 21st centuri we should be ambiti enough not onli to build the largest hydropow plant in the world but also to have world class individu unit capac sever individu unit capac plan are describ in the follow use a turbin diamet of d sup 1 9 5 m a design head of h 85 m and a turbin forc of n 6 9 million kw the unit flow of the

is a non standard valu of 9 85 m the output of the turbin is 729 mw and the gener unit produc 700 mw thi plan ensur that the individu unit capac at the three gorg is equal to that at two exist famou power plant i e the itaipu at the brazil paraguay border and the grand coule dam in the unit state the number of unit remain unchang and the layout doe not need to be alter the total instal capac is 700mw x 26 18 200mw which is 520 000 kw higher than that in the valid plan second is plan 5 the turbin diamet is d1 10 40 m the turbin output is 824 700 kw and the gener unit output is 800 000 kw becaus the plan requir the use of a 13 5 m diamet pressur steel pipe the center distanc between unit is increas by 3 m in order to keep the flood gate and ship lock in their origin posit the north and south plant need to reduc the number of unit by one each i e 13 unit in the north and 11 in the south the total number is 24 and the overal instal capac is 800mw x 24 19 200mw it is 1 52mw larger than that in the valid plan a station of the same length can accommod 22 0 9mw unit with a total instal capac of 19 8 million kw or 20 1mw unit with a total instal capac of 20 million kw it is obviou that instal 0 8mw unit is the most effect way to rais the overal instal capac by the end of thi centuri china should have the capabl to manufactur 800mw gener unit it is also possibl to jointli design and manufactur with foreign firm as in the case of the geheyan hydropow station it also may be possibl to solicit intern bid for some of the unit h5 3 conclus h5 the three gorg hydropow station must take the compens and regul effect of the hydropow station upstream 30 year from now into account it must take full advantag of it locat at the center of nation power grid and gener as much power for peak shave as possibl it should have the maximum instal capac possibl to enhanc it peak shave capabl it is recommend that 24 gener unit with an individu unit capac of 800mw be place sinc there is essenti no chang in plant length and locat there will be minim chang to the water flow downstream the diamet of the steel pipe is increas by 10 percent to 13 5 m the increas in difficulti to manufactur should be easi to handl our hydropow expert scholar and colleagu should revalid the individu unit capac and unit number base on the new socialist market economi there is still time to chang the design despit the fact that two 170 000 kw unit were success test at the erjiang station of gezhouba the dajiang station refus to use it instead it is still use the smaller 125 000 kw unit the consequ are that it is wast water 100 day a year hope thi will not happen at the three gorg the plan to instal 24 800mw unit at the three gorg is of vital import
