power industri moscow text the total product of the fuel and energi resourc in 1990 1992 declin primarili due to a decreas in the coal and oil product the lack of technic readi to extract oil from the ground use more complic practic preclud attempt at stabil or even increas somewhat the oil product in the next 30 40 year coal product will increas yet it will be util primarili near the mine locat in russia s eastern region due to the difficulti of deliv it to the western region an increas in the ga product should be treat as an import yet difficult to meet goal the plan nuclear power develop scale would hardli make it possibl to complet russia s fuel balanc such a situat necessit a search for new energi sourc in recent decad scientist in russia and abroad focus attent on the possibl of util the heat releas dure the split of the so call high molecular silic m sup 2 o sup _x_sio sub 2 type where m na or k and _x_ 3 or 4 e g the na sup 2 o sup 3sio sub 2 silic in thi case anhydr silicon compound of the sir type where r c or n may serv as the split substanc e g a mixtur of silicon carbid and nitrid sic si sup 3 n sub 4 the fission process may occur in two way the first is the convent chemic reaction which is character by the interact of materi particl the second physic chemic chain reaction which is determin by the level of the materi energi reaction chain a chain reaction may develop onli in the case where the energi releas dure the occurr of the preced reaction is suffici to start the next one academician a n semenov character these type of reaction as the develop of a chain process by mean of energi chain the fission process occur until the develop of the na sup 2 o sup sio sub 2 low modulu silic and co and sio carbon and silicon monoxid accord to the gener theori of chain reaction the presenc of activ silic complex and energi chain alon is insuffici to ensur a chain process the crucial featur is the presenc of the so call critic mass of the silic not all silic can break up by the chain mechan in a number of silic the necessari initi energi in the initi state is consolid onli partial so it must be addit consolid artifici from the initi substanc for exampl in produc the na sup 2 o sup 3sio sub 2 silic from the origin product i e sodium carbon and sand 1 na sup 2 co sub 3 3sio sub 2 na sup 2 o sup 3sio sub 2 co sup 2 thi process is wide known and is util in the glass make industri the quantiti of energi releas dure fission is calcul from the follow formula 1 2 2 q k sup i sup 10 sup 3n where k is the indic of the fuel type and puriti and n is the coeffici of the chain reaction order for the hydrat process n 0 for a chemic reaction n 1 for a physic chemic reaction n 2 for a nuclear reaction n 3 and for a fusion reaction n 4 analys show that in the cours of a pure chemic decomposit reaction 1 kg of silic releas 3 350 cal of heat 2 which is the same as ekibastuz coal while in a chain physic chemic reaction it releas 8 5 million kcal i e in thi case it may replac 1 000 t of fuel oil physic chemic silic chain reaction amount to a phase transform dure the process at first the high modulu silic is in the solid phase to trigger it decomposit process it is necessari to suppli a rel small quantiti of initi energi from outsid as a result it will be partial convert to the liquid phase and the chain reaction will begin to develop given a total transit of the critic silic mass to the liquid state reaction byproduct and energi are releas abruptli at a rate of an explos one can retard the energi releas onli by ad to the molten silic mass special rod from anhydr silic compound and withdraw them insert of the rod increas the energi chain multipl factor while their withdraw decreas it the energi releas in the devic as a result of the high modulu silic split under the effect of anhydr silicon compound may be broadli util virtual in all branch of the nation economi with the help of a convent heat exchang circuit use well known design the gain from the transit to silic fuel is indisput for exampl we know that 39 t of liquid fuel are pump into the tank of the tu 154 airplan yet the same energi can be deriv from 39 kg of silic silic fuel is inexpens and approxim 1 5 million t of it is produc annual in russia in the power industri silic power plant could be instal in place of boiler plant at thermal electr power plant and larg boiler room thi is a new environment clean type of fuel which is especi desir for heat and power gener plant with a combin heat and electr product as well as larg urban boiler room locat in residenti construct and suburban area the high modulu silic decay product i e co and sio are not discharg into the atmospher but are forward to a special recoveri modul in thi modul carbon monoxid is convert to carbon dioxid while silicon monoxid into silicon dioxid these substanc are use for silic recoveri 3 na sup 2 sup sio sub 2 2sio sup 2 na sup 2 o sup 3sio sub 2 the thermal pollut of the

diagram of a power plant with a gaseou energi sourc is shown in the figur in contrast to boiler furnac heat transfer in the water wall tube is realiz due to heat transfer from the more heat medium to the less heat medium through the pipe wall rather than due to radi transport from the fuel combust flare silic power engin is still in it infanc today the state associ of the nation scientif research
