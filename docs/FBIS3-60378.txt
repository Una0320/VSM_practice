languag f p 105 french f articl type bfn f p 106 articl by jean claud oppeneau biotechnolog and f environ text there is no shortag of exampl of the contribut biotechnolog ha made to solv environment problem new market are open up to these technolog which have alreadi been use in the treatment of water wast or contamin land howev organ convert by genet engin requir vigil and reflect by both research and manufactur in term of their secur and ecolog impact a balanc must be found between econom competit and respect for the environ biotechnolog are take an increasingli import part in solv environment problem the fungu phanerochaet chrysosporium for instanc secret enzym which can damag lignin the phenomenon is well known but less well known are the result of recent research which show that thi fungu can also degrad certain herbicid heavi oil or toxic product it is also thought it may be use to treat hydrocarbon which have accumul in the ground thi could enabl the rehabilit of certain contamin site a crucial problem today these hope have captur the interest of mani compani notabl in the unit state and have result in a race to select hyperproduct line with a view to optim the use of fungi seem promis for the futur becaus these organ can colon vast region while bacteria develop in more limit zone there is also increas talk about biomass combust and the use of biofuel although wood combust is use rel littl in franc other countri have no hesit about use it regularli and in denmark new inciner burn hay despit it critic biofuel continu to be test and the compar eco audit between rapese and diesel doe not condemn veget diester other option exist such as wheat and beetroot for the product of ethanol and oxygen compon for lead free ga or wood for the product of methanol for exampl not forget the latest develop by english research who are experi on power suppli for diesel engin gener unit use an alga which feed on the liquid use for reprocess sewag water thi green monocel alga chlorella ha an extrem rapid growth rate and the carbon ga result from combust is recycl to improv the output of photosynthesi even further h5 new market h5 biolog open up whole new technolog area for process and product becaus they are young these have the specif characterist that they can benefit from studi on risk parallel to their develop thi ha been a rare occurr throughout histori it wa remark that thi wa a grow problem dure discuss on the present of the bill on genet modifi organ gmo s at the nation assembl in econom term a recent american report biomark 93 forecast for high growth market put forward sever interest figur the use of ground bacteria indigen or exogen to treat contamin should grow to the tune of 20 to 30 percent per year between now and the end of the decad it is estim that the market for microorgan capabl of desulphur carbon will rise to sever billion dollar a year around the year 2000 for the recuper of metal in wast use biolog process thi estim rise to nearli two billion dollar in 1998 h5 live mechan h5 we are enter the age of worker microb true sauerkraut or roquefort chees were alreadi made with their help the use of microorgan for industri product is when all is said and done ecolog satisfactori as live be they requir more natur or softer work condit than tradit industri process factori use them will essenti be more hospit than those use machin temperatur pressur acid etc will not creat area of danger as threaten as those in chemic or nuclear environ howev some regul on their product and util need to be enforc the environ ministri is veri concern by the industri use of microorgan and prior research there will be extraordinari progress in their util at the begin of the next centuri and thi will lead to drastic chang in life style thi is one of the reason whi it is so import to initi an in depth deliber on the effect of thi progress on the impact of genet engin and to lay the foundat of a polici centr on precaut and ethic while encourag innov and research and provid guarante for a control evolut progress is fast move in thi field there are mani patent and product author in the world and franc doe not alway take the lead on these issu h5 water and biotechnolog h5 the biotechnolog environ twosom have alreadi come along way togeth import research program have enabl process to be develop and some of these are oper today in term of water whether for the product of drink water or the purif of wast water the use of microorgan in an aerob or anaerob environ is inevit for drink water the excess of dissolv biodegrad organ carbon undergo biolog treatment use the properti of bacteria fix on activ carbon and biolog nitrif or denitrif is often use the treatment of wast water frequent requir a biolog process which includ lagoon and if a higher level of purif need to be achiev treatment on bacteri bed or the use of activ mud today howev in order to overcom certain difficulti link to mechan procedur the develop of biofilt which lead to increas the biomass activ by the use of cultur of microorgan fix on a fine granul environ is indispens for the treatment of residu industri water the use of membran bioreactor could be advantag similarli the biolog dephosphat of water is an interest option the divers of usabl biotechnolog today and the capac to discov new approach for the futur will enabl current techniqu to be improv consider h5 wast too h5 the outlook is the same for the treatment of wast we know about the methan of silag slaughter hous residu breweri dreg etc but also of household wast we know how to develop rudimentari mechan perfectli adapt to develop countri in thi respect the remark experi of the treatment of residu from the thi slaughterhous in seneg should be mention thi process enabl the elimin of solid and liquid residu through methan and lagoon with water hyacinth which suppli the energi requir to oper the slaughterhous furthermor it transform the substrat and yield a protein rich materi capabl of increas the product of marsh cultur for a lower than usual cost in other respect bioleach and biofix are subject to increas research for the treatment of wast which is rich in heavi metal h5 clean up contamin land h5 rehabilit treatment for contamin land is anoth field of investig undergo rapid develop the problem thi pose for the substrata and in relat to ground water or futur exploit are such that it is absolut necessari to clean up these land but the cost of do so can reach excess level if the most suitabl process is not chosen the biolog solut is often the most accept thi question is central to mani program around the world some eureka project were recent launch focus on the differ possibl and certain result look promis h5 from air to biosensor h5 anoth import area of biolog clean cover the reduct of atmospher pollut the desulphur and denitrif of smoke the elimin of toxic product such as organochlorin and deodor biolog sensor provid one exampl of the use of microorgan for the develop of new instrument in environ relat applic system use fluoresc bacteria or bacteria which are sensit to certain type of pollut in measur sensor enabl the qualiti of waterway to be control or alert to be rais biotechnolog have not yet ceas surpris us in the fight against pollut who would have thought we would be abl to use these technolog to recuper preciou metal in miner in which trace of these are present and for which tradit process gener pollut h5 agricultur and the environ h5 genet engin is now also at the servic agricultur and again relat with the environ are far from neglig there are current mani joint program between the nation agronom research institut inra and the environ ministri obtain plant capabl of resist insect and fungi could liber farmer from the overus of chemic product which would greatli benefit both the land and anim life entomophag insect could also be use which would have the effect of limit the use of pesticid onc again the limit of these applic would have to be studi and in depth work undertaken on the biolog resist phenomenon we should keep in mind the prolifer of insect in venic or the case of cricket in africa other invent such as plant with protein reserv salt resist plant could be a godsend to develop countri h5 genet modifi organ h5 opinion vari on the subject of genet modifi organ gmo s introduc into the environ some say they are monster creat in laboratori which stand no chanc of surviv and which will be ruthlessli elimin by natur select process for other they will invad the environ all environ indiscrimin and will therefor drive out other microorgan and creat other problem it is inde possibl that they possess differ properti than those plan by their inventor and most of the time we ignor their capac to adapt to differ environ we should rememb that undesir speci easili invad whole contin while man often ha difficulti introduc speci he would like to propag the debat is vast it seem obviou that the necessari and adequ condit for the surviv or the rapid multipl of gmo s are the respons of ecolog specialist becaus inform result from in vitro cultur alon will not provid the respons requir thi is whi the use of these organ should be accompani by research on their ecolog impact the effect of the introduct whether deliber or accident of variou organ the problem of myxomatosi killer bee elm diseas are well known transgen plant also merit further reflect introduc a foreign gene into a plant with ulterior exploit motiv requir reflect on the possibl consequ befor the choic of the differ element which constitut the construct chain the plasmid vector the transform system and the plant to be transform are even made thi is not about be alarmist but be equip with the best possibl knowledg of the genet content of the materi about to be develop thi could avoid difficulti at the time of field test or dure homolog process h5 biodivers h5 in some respect biotechnolog can aggrav genet harmon and the reduct of genet divers is a fundament problem today paradox it can also help provid solut genet eros can be combat by constitut stock of gene through develop tissu cultur in mali for exampl peasant import potato tissu from belgium they succeed in import a more diseas resist veget materi while econom on the transport cost for plant ecolog research must be strengthen to test the evolut that blind develop in genet engin could bring about and particularli in the plant world natur is be increasingli mould by man but biodivers is certainli an indispens advantag for it surviv notabl if we are enter a period of gallop demographi thi is whi an approach where the use of biotechnolog is control and regul is need h5 necessari scientif vigil h5 biotechnolog are no less abstract than other modern industri process escherichia coli a famou bacteria despit it presenc in our intestin is no more familiar than carbon 14 or ani other isol molecul although it use is grow and under mani differ guis so are we not deal with them regularli so artifici bacteria need not be experi more commonli than plutonium or dioxin creat it watch over it and use it will be the task of specialist for a long time to come and not that of ordinari mortal other than except thi is whi scientif vigil is capit as it is import to evalu the ecotoxicolog consequ on differ environ at the begin techniqu call on microorgan which some peopl said had been use sinc antiqu did not seem to be at the sourc of ani particularli great risk but the appear and util of genet engin techniqu have complet chang thi convict these techniqu which enabl the potenti of microorgan to be transform and even new capabl to be brought about by modifi the genom have given rise over the past decad to question base on both ethic and secur the experi we have to date of their util and industri applic is not yet suffici advanc in a certain number of sector to enabl all the doubt we have encount to be remov complet h5 reconcil contradict h5 the approach is direct like for a number of other activ by a search for an indispens balanc between two level which can in certain case seem contradictori name econom competit activ and the live of peopl so if prevent and regulatori activ must be introduc scientif research must bring light to bear on potenti risk and research must adopt a practic simultan attitud of vigil in relat to the futur impact of their result on the environ from the veri launch of a project thi is a golden opportun for onc to develop new techniqu have taken their consequ into consider from the veri begin
