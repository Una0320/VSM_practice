cso text h5 the posit use of plutonium from lwr is insepar h5 connect to the fuel cycl current within japan activ discuss is go forward between group such as the atom energi commiss the govern the util compani and the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corp pnc regard the futur develop of fast breeder reactor fbr we are publish in thi edit an extract of a portion of an articl futur fbr topic fbr and plutonium util technolog by yoshiro takahashi deputi chairman of the pnc s develop promot headquart thi articl wa taken from the proceed of the report and lectur meet which wa carri out last month by the pnc pnc ha complet the prototyp reactor monju util independ technolog from the begin of the develop of thi fbr h5 the appeal of fbr h5 first from the standpoint of effect util of uranium resourc fbr possess superior characterist when compar to other type of reactor chart no 1 below show an exampl of when plutonium fuel recycl is use an apprais of the relationship between the percentag composit of plutonium isotop as shown on the y axi and the number of time the plutonium fuel is recycl as shown on the x axi for both light water reactor lwr and fbr compar to lwr when recycl is done in an fbr even if the number of recycl is increas the percentag of isotop which can caus fission in other word the amount of fissil plutonium doe not decreas significantli in other word if recycl is done in an fbr it is possibl to carri out the recycl countless time and the problem of plutonium age doe not exist fig id jpr jst 015l 61a chart no 1 chang in the composit of pu isotop fig anoth appeal of fbr is that element such as minor actinid which were hitherto consid wast materi can be use as fuel in thi type of reactor and therefor the burden place on the back end can be reduc therefor through burn the plutonium produc at lwr and fbr thi weak point of nuclear power util can be effect util as a valuabl resourc final becaus of fbr s superior rate of thermal effici wast heat can be reduc to the utmost thi is an outstand characterist from the point of view of environment protect h5 scenario for bring fbr into actual use h5 up until now nuclear power util ha develop reli on lwr in order to util fbr it is necessari to bring into harmoni and unifi lwr recycl technolog and fbr recycl technolog when econom assess are discuss it is not fit that just fbr are talk about rather the debat should includ the evalu of lwr fbr and recycl technolog in gener we will show that the best scenario is for us to move as quickli as possibl to discard the system use mainli lwr and gradual move toward system which reli on fbr chart no 2 below show the relationship between total free world uranium demand and resourc volum through around the year 2030 at which time the total demand will approach the total amount of resourc suppli becaus the percentag of facil cost as a part of the total construct cost is high if nuclear power plant are not use for their entir durabl life span they are not econom in fact becaus fuel suppli are secur by long term contract which last for 20 year if you consid the amount of uranium secur by contract in 2030 the amount of uranium requir will clearli exceed the total demand amount shown below therefor it is possibl that there could be a failur of the uranium suppli balanc befor 2030 fig id jpr jst 015l 62a chart no 2 free world uranium demand fig on the other hand if new uranium resourc are discov the urgenc of thi trend will be reliev there are those who take the optimist view of thi situat say if the uranium suppli balanc break down then the develop of new uranium mine will proceed therefor for the time be there is no urgenc with regard to uranium resourc thi attitud of do noth while simpli wait for such good fortun is noth more than underestim the urgenc of the uranium suppli situat no one can guarante the discoveri of new larg scale uranium reserv to prepar for the urgent uranium suppli situat it is exceedingli import to prepar the technolog system requir to make possibl the util of fbr plutonium recycl by about 2030 as long as uranium is use in lwr it is inevit that plutonium will be produc as state abov it is fbr that can make use of thi plutonium and effect util uranium resourc next i will explain whi it is so import to introduc fbr as quickli as possibl the follow is an exampl of analysi show just how much fbr can contribut to the power suppli assum the plutonium recycl technolog system is prepar and fbr are introduc into the system start in 2030 chart no 3 below show the result of analysi base on the supposit of the high case as shown abov wherein japan s nuclear power plant capac at the end of 2030 top 100 million kilowatt and where the rate of growth experienc between 2010 and 2030 continu after 2030 thi analysi wa base on the follow supposit an annual amount of reprocess spent fuel from lwr base on uranium mass convers of 1 600 ton a life span for lwr and fbr of 40 year an fbr breed ratio of 1 2 and an out of reactor fuel cycl durat of three year fig id jpr jst 015l 62b chart no 3 estim of nuclear power plant fig even in a case where fbr are introduc all of the spent fuel from lwr and fbr is rapidli reprocess and all of the plutonium recov is util after 2030 even if fbr are introduc to their greatest possibl extent fbr alon will not be abl to keep pace with anticip demand and therefor it will be necessari to build new lwr introduct of new lwr now mean that there will be no surplu of plutonium after 2030 in other word thi show that until around 2070 there will be inadequ suppli of plutonium to meet grow demand plutonium for the fbr which will replac the lwr that have pass their life span nobodi is argu the fact that we will need fbr in the futur but we still reli on lwr today if we stop turn the spent fuel from these lwr into wast and instead recycl that fuel it can becom a stabl energi suppli for the futur the plutonium balanc is current be debat there are mani peopl who are of the opinion that becaus of econom consider the bring into actual use of fbr should be push back later and later it can be said howev that the best way to bring thi reactor technolog into actual use is to build the reactor while make improv after improv and while consid the pursuit of econom characterist steadili develop a demonstr reactor and then a commerci reactor while maintain the plutonium balanc base on thi analysi of an fbr introduct scenario at an earli period of fbr commerci it is necessari to increas the breed ratio and decreas the time of the out of reactor cycl in order not to overus fbr at the begin of cours if abund suppli of uranium resourc were avail then it would be possibl to consid a more relax introduct scenario howev base on the develop effort it is import to util plutonium in fbr at an earli date furthermor when the fbr have reach matur it is import to adjust their breed ratio and when mankind chang over to anoth energi sourc to remov plutonium from the face of the earth in other word it is necessari to elimin all of the plutonium the develop of technolog which will make these thing feasibl is an oblig which ha been place upon the develop of today with that let s undertak thi new duti in cooper with countri such as the unit state and franc h5 the statu of monju h5 regard the current statu of fbr develop our countri ha complet the reactor monju and we are at the stage where we can pursu the implement and econom viabil of a plant system that can extract heat as energi current at monju prepar are move steadili forward in prepar for the first critic of the reactor which is schedul for april of next year after that test will take place on the reactor physic the nuclear superheat and output test if thing go smoothli the plant is plan to enter regular oper in the end of 1995 h5 prospect for commerci h5 japan s demonstr reactor have enter into a stage where they can be steadili improv base on monju in order for fbr to come into actual use across the board improv need to be plan in area such as reactor safeti and reliabl along with reactor economi furthermor it is also necessari to increas the level of accept for these reactor within societi befor the time of their commerci around 2030 in order to do thi it is necessari to steadili proceed with the construct oper of a demonstr reactor follow after monju and to carri out experiment for the accumul of technolog and experi and aim at develop technolog need to bring fbr toward futur commerci
