languag f p 105 russian f articl type cso f p 106 articl by leonid repin comment under the titl ra f viru with yellow eye you haven t heard of thi diseas but by the way more than 10 million russian are infect with it text two type of hepat b and c bear frankli mortal danger for man have been grow here into an enorm problem accord to the calcul of specialist more than 10 million russian are infect with hepat c and it can be suppos in fact no one know thi precis mani more are infect with hepat b it is the agent of thi diseas in particular that is more widespread than of all the other hepat and it is into the bargain more danger it is follow hepat b in particular that cancer frequent develop to an even greater degre than from hepat c if one look at the problem from opposit perspect it turn out that the viru of hepat c is found in nineti per cent of patient with cirrhosi and cancer of the liver the situat is complic by the fact that the major of oncolog patient are also treat among other method by mean of the scalpel and are transfus with donat blood and that no one can state with certainti that ill fate hepat is not introduc into these patient with thi blood becaus here we do not carri out such investig if that is the case and most like it is the case then frequent oper oncolog patient die not of the cancer but of subsequ complic like acut hepat insuffici but after all that s how matter turn it s not accident howev that hepat c in particular is more and more often call the plagu of the twentieth centuri not aid but thi curs hepat of our the american were the first to becom alarm and to take up the struggl against hepat c in a concert manner they develop and began to produc diagnost prepar to identifi case of hepat c it wa they who carri out the first mass survey the result prove stagger 85 per cent of patient with chronic hepat had acquir the ubiquit viru follow blood transfus the problem in our countri ha becom especi acut about 22 million dose of blood were given in the last year of the exist of the ussr that mean that there should have been an equal number of analys even if it is assum that one analysi cost a dollar while in fact is it is more expens it is not difficult to imagin how much such analys for the hepat c content would cost understand we did not do such analys and inde they are not done now i donut know perhap they are in special except case but it is necessari to do them if for no other reason than otherwis the consequ will be unpredict peopl who by the veri charact of their work know the natur of the hepat viru transmit with blood are ring the alarm attempt to attract attent to the mortal danger lurk in the shadow of mani other problem oncologist professor g a tkacheva analyz the pathway along which the hepat c viru reach the organ of healthi peopl conclud about 60 million peopl pass through russia s medic hospit a year peopl who is oper on and transfus with blood are treat conserv but they must all be administ drug intraven and that is the path of infect all els asid the troubl lie in the fact that even the acut form of hepat veri often progress with weakli manifest symptom and therefor mani case remain total unrecogn someon is sick and grave sick and no one know whi thi alarm situat is aggrav also by the fact that thi viru is transmit not onli through everi possibl medic manipul but by sexual intimaci as well like the aid viru and even through the most ordinari social contact between peopl so you see the kind of disast so is there no rescu specialist believ that a nation program of unreserv examin of donor blood and of all blood go into the prepar of everi possibl type of pharmaceut of all patient subject to contact with needl and scalpel of all pregnant women and all children is the onli way the chameleon viru can be conquer it stand to reason the creation of the domest manufactur of diagnost prepar must be provid for in thi program otherwis after all we are prefer to pay insan amount of money to foreign firm for readi made prepar and are therefor condemn to buy them into the futur instead of organ our own product my old good friend correspond member of the russian academi of scienc professor m s balayan who ha been deal with the hepat all hi life and ha carri out an extrem danger experi on himself nevertheless confid to me with a smile perhap we shouldn t panic although of cours all that is so all that is correct the danger is great just consid the fact that in the last ten year about fifteen previous unknown infect have come to light it is normal that they come to light what is abnorm is that we begin to combat them late ye in fact he and i recal togeth an unknown bacteri diseas had suddenli broken out strike down the major of the particip of a congress of legionnair who had gather not so long ago in the us thu it wa call legionnair diseas vilyuisk encephalomyel unknown to scienc a terribl slow infect inexor destroy the brain wa discov in thi countri they learn to treat legionnair diseas the vilyuisk diseas ha remain a riddl but it ha not attempt to extend it boundari hepat on the other hand run about rage wildli throughout the entir unprotect land that you see is the kind of danger it is
