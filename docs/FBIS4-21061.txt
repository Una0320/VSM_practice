dure discuss of the new penal procedur code in the sens the approv provis were go to creat confus ambigu and would lend themselv to critic from nation and intern public opinion have your statement been corrobor in practic arrieta you know the attorney gener s offic ha maintain a posit in thi regard for a long time we believ if thi countri want to develop a seriou and coher crimin polici on the drug struggl it must have solid and strong regul that permit it to advanc in thi matter i think thi doe not exist the attorney gener s offic ha state on sever occas the penal code is weak and doe not establish appropri sentenc for drug traffick crime and the penal procedur code is a confus and profus regul it doe not establish clear procedur and if it is handl inappropri it could lead to impun arizmendi what would have to be done to strengthen thi penal code and establish appropri sentenc to avoid what is happen arrieta i believ the countri must definit undertak an integr project to reform the penal code and the penal procedur code i am not aim at a larg project to modifi all the provis but coher legisl should be issu regard drug traffick someth veri worrisom is take place as violenc increas dure the last six or seven year occasion legisl reaction have sprung up and new and differ provis have been issu a judg or attorney must now appli 60 or 70 differ provis concern drug traffick in order to understand the norm or applic situat in a particular case thi creat confus and doe not produc the necessari clariti in deal with thi matter natur the countri s problem is not relat to regul onli but it ha mani addit aspect one of the first step that would have to be taken is a definit integr coher and systemat with exist legisl so as to tighten sentenc and clarifi procedur arizmendi a desir and unanim decis by the variou organ would be requir name from the justic ministri the prosecutor gener s offic and the attorney gener s offic thi agreement doe not exist arrieta i think thi requir an effort by all concern organ not onli the govern judiciari or attorney gener s offic but also congress which is ultim respons for issu the code i believ the graviti of the circumst and the question of colombia justifi an unvari and strong reaction from all colombian to show that thi countri is not a narcodemocraci we must demonstr thi is a countri that is inde readi to fight drug traffick passag omit arizmendi colombia at thi moment is in the eye of the u s media and mani u s congressmen the countri is well awar of the letter exchang between the prosecutor gener s offic and the u s attorney gener the respons of the colombian ambassador to the washington post s 6 april articl by senat kerri in sum doe thi confus and confront origin in the verbal reckless of the prosecutor or exist regul arrieta i think there are mani factor that come into play here i think we are face a problem that ha evolv for no reason from basic discuss on legal issu we have gone to such express as narcodemocraci or the question of colombian justic i think thi is the right time to end thi i do not know what is the caus and cannot offer a specif solut the caus may be a combin of the factor you mention the absolut truth is i as attorney gener and a colombian citizen cannot allow thi to continu we have reach such harsh term as the one we have seen in recent day without ani justif the word indistinct ha snowbal into such dimens i believ we must put a definit end to thi becaus thi is affect not onli the function of colombian institut but relat with the unit state thi may have more seriou effect we cannot forese at thi moment our respons is to end thi problem we must not act separ but we must act in a coordin manner arizmendi how can we end thi problem and how can we act in a coordin manner who is the one out of line arrieta i told you earlier i will issu a communiqu today on that issu in it we will adopt a posit on thi matter we will provid a complet pictur of what ha happen but at thi moment i believ it is fundament for us to make an effort so that the situat will not continu to intensifi and doe not affect all colombian passag omit arizmendi mr attorney gener turn to anoth topic and go back somewhat to what we were talk about at the begin of our convers you said on televis last night that at thi time you do not think the condit or circumst exist for new surrend of cali cartel drug traffick on what basi did you make thi statement arrieta i think what we discuss a short while ago suffici support thi i do not think the condit exist at thi specif time the environ is not the appropri one there is a great distrust and prejudic there is great concern about the whole topic i think the most import thing is to calm the water again to have the author sit down and agre on polici and then proceed with the surrend to justic program in these day at thi particular moment i think the atmospher is too heat to make a surrend to justic process feasibl i am not set a time limit thi might be solv in eight 10 15 day or in one or two month what i have alway said is that the surrend to justic polici is import for the countri it is use i think that as colombian we should tri to move forward with it with clear and firm rule but as circumst stand at thi time with the level of debat take place both nation and intern i think there should be at least a halt a temporari halt which might last a few day or somewhat longer accord to word indistinct arizmendi in other word we might say the attorney gener is propos the process of surrend to justic by the drug traffick be frozen until there is an agreement jurid or polit to make the sentenc against these drug traffick harsher or more rigor arrieta i cannot propos that it be frozen among other thing simpli becaus the legal provis exist and they establish the possibl of surrend therefor if tomorrow an individu present himself befor a prosecutor or judg of the countri there is no other altern but to receiv him what i think is that regard a broad case such as that of the cali cartel which ha polit and jurid word indistinct and which requir full coordin among all the author i do not think it would be appropri to advanc with thi process until we reach agreement on all the paramet under which we should act as soon as that occur someth which might be done veri rapidli then we could if thi is what is desir continu with that process at thi time at a time of debat when the atmospher is heat and when posit are not entir clear i think howev it would not be appropri becaus the countri would simpli not understand it precis becaus of the prevail climat of distrust and confus arizmendi you said the legal provis exist evid in the penal code and the penal procedur code you also said in the past the surrend to justic polici ha end replac by the code if the sentenc are evid so minim ridicul and short as certain u s author assert one might then think thi is exactli the best time for the cali cartel drug traffick to surrend massiv befor the code are reform and made harsher arrieta of cours of cours that is the posit they not further identifi might want i think our posit as a state is precis to tri to design all the mechan so there will be a surrend process but one that will not creat ani feel of impun under ani viewpoint of cours what you mention is part of the dilemma that alway aris on the one hand there are a number of peopl who want to take advantag of the law for their own benefit thi is inevit and is the reason whi lawyer procedur and legal provis exist on the other hand there is the state which ha the respons to fulfil it social function and to ensur those legal provis are appli the best way possibl what i am suggest is that there be a review of the overal reform of the legal provis so that we can have a penal code procedur provis and a surrend to justic polici which are clear and which do not produc ani kind of impun passag omit arizmendi whi is the prosecutor gener the onli one take all the flak when all he is realli do is interpret and appli code provis in congress you courag warn the countri about what wa come and unfortun time ha shown you were right but the prosecutor gener wa not the one who drew up the code it wa congress and in congress justic minist andr gonzalez even chang the mean of certain bill and he defend what wa final approv in congress now the prosecutor gener is the one be critic when the govern wa also involv in what wa final approv the govern sign the law arrieta i think one ha to put thi issu back into perspect if one look at what ha been take place in the past two or three month there have not realli been new action in the applic of the penal and penal procedur code there ha been debat and it ha been grow but onli base on topic that are not directli link to the penal procedur code such as the issu of legal and the issu of whether the struggl against drug traffick ha work all of thi ha led us to a debat what not onli involv think about aspect of polici but also aspect of norm i agre with you in part that a portion of the problem is not onli caus by isol action but also by the veri exist of legal provis which are not clear and are inappropri therefor what we propos is that we halt a debat that is not take us anywher with the increas in crime what we colombian must do is form a barrier a unit front with everyon confront the problem face the problem entail a review of legal provis to resolv all those vacuum all those weak that might exist in the code it entail act in a coordin way becaus it is a problem of nation interest which not onli involv one institut but all colombian arizmendi lastli mr attorney gener and thank you for your willing to speak with caracol network so extens about such relev topic i would like to know whether the attorney gener s offic know the name of the infiltr in the prosecutor gener s offic who the state depart say belong to the cali cartel and four high rank govern offici who the state depart said last night also work for the cali cartel arrieta i want to make a comment regard the question in the state depart report it is said the colombian govern is studi the fourth rank person in the offic of what they call the attorney gener preced two word in english the american make a distinct between the offic of the attorney gener preced two word in english which is the attorney gener s offic procuraduria gener de la nacion and the offic of the prosecutor gener preced two word in english which is the prosecutor gener s offic fiscal gener de la nacion when they said the fourth rank person in the offic of the attorney gener preced two word in english wa be investig they were refer to what they call the fourth rank person in the attorney gener s offic it is a case that for us ha been extrem mortifi and pain it is the case of dr guillermo villa they were not refer to a person in the prosecutor gener s offic but to a person in the attorney gener s offic it is a case that is well known and ha been suffici debat by public opinion i think it is import that thi be clarifi becaus shadow of doubt should not be cast over other peopl regard the other four peopl who might be investig i do not have inform about them arizmendi in the case of dr guillermo villa alzat who you just mention what is happen arrieta i think the process is about to conclud the final phase of the evid period are be carri out and as far as the attorney gener s offic is concern i hope that in the cours of the next few week at the latest in one or two month a definit decis is go to be made
