languag f p 105 french f articl type cso f p 106 articl controversi breeder reactor will be convert f into radioact wast inciner text no fewer than three minist gerard longuet industri michel barnier environ and francoi fillon research tri yesterday to justifi the surpris decis edouard balladur made on tuesday 22 februari regard the futur of superphoenix see yesterday s edit superphoenix will no longer be oper as a nuclear power plant but will becom a research and demonstr reactor more precis one of the world s most controversi nuclear facil after chernobyl and kozloduy will henceforth be use as a sub gener for research on inciner of nuclear wast all the three of the minist clamor to emphas the provision natur of the decis we will have the opportun to reconsid it later on they said again and again a fact that is instruct on two count first by convert superphoenix into an inciner franc is abandon after five year of waver a controversi field of research electr gener by breeder reactor which produc more fuel than they consum thu leav japan virtual the singl propon of the technolog superphoenix wa built to be a breeder reactor and onli that second edouard balladur s team believ in the econom recoveri it ha been herald for the first time sinc the 1970 the first oil shock the french govern is commit itself to a major new research project at the same time admit it is not in a posit to say how much it will cost there is talk it will amount to billion of french franc and all for the sake of result which at least accord to independ nuclear expert will be of littl interest around the world there are no current industri applic for superphoenix as a sub gener assum it oper at full power which it ha not done sinc 1988 a superphoenix reactor can consum onli 200 kilogram annual of the plutonium end product a highli toxic wast produc by ordinari nuclear reactor franc s 60 reactor creat 11 ton a year of it thu if one were to use the inciner techniqu to solv today s nuclear wast problem one would have to build 60 superphoenix no one want to do that inde parliament in 1991 prescrib a quit differ nuclear wast dispos polici burial h5 inciner h5 the govern believ howev that an in depth studi of an altern to burial would be use michel barnier explain that the environ ministri wa happi to see a research program on inciner of cumbersom nuclear wast the parliamentarian from rhone alp said noth about hi lack of enthusiasm for reactiv the breeder reactor but he betray the same squeamish as fellow alp region repres bernard bosson regard the polit sensit of the crey malvil problem in ain among their colleagu onli alain carignon anoth local deputi and member of the govern doe not share their discreet repugn of cours hi district is also reap dividend from the reactor s presenc but edouard balladur s decis impli that the veri small alpin lobbi carri veri littl weight against the massiv nuclear industri lobbi inde what gerard longuet and francoi fillon said yesterday wa larg deriv from a 1993 report submit by jean teillac former high commission for the atom energi commiss cea from a strictli technic perspect superphoenix pose a seriou question for the govern will there be ani need for breeder reactor technolog over the next two or three decad the crey malvil reactor wa design in the 1970 to make franc self suffici in nuclear fuel at a time when the first oil crisi wa bring to an end the thirti gloriou year i e after world war ii sinc then the market for such fuel ha taken a perman nosed and enthusiasm for nuclear energi wane follow the implos at three mile island unit state 1979 and the explos at chernobyl ukrain 1986 final from a technic standpoint the crey malvil prototyp ha been noth but troubl the most recent debacl juli 1990 led to a temporari shutdown of the reactor it ha never been restart and as a result of variou jurid maneuv it wa depriv in juli 1992 of it legal statu which onli recent ha been restor h5 opposit h5 superphoenix ha serv abov all as a focal point for the never held debat on the gener direct of a french nuclear polici that ha diverg from european norm a debat first of all within franc itself and in the countri on it border in tradit antinuclear itali of cours although the countri s scrupl never prevent it from buy french electr but also in switzerland geneva state counselor claud haegi said yesterday that if the decis is ultim made to restart it geneva would express it opposit most reaction yesterday were predict local near the power plant and so depend on them econom express satisfact on the other hand all the countri s environmentalist movement greenpeac the european against superphoenix associ etc noisili express their indign the govern is gambl that oppon will not be abl to forg an effect coalit and there were two argument that outweigh other consider for the govern obvious sensit to the vulner of a nuclear industri that is as unhappi as it oppon are about crey malvil and what it ha come to symbol it wa simpli unthink for superphoenix to be shut down in the final analysi as the edf french power compani and cea have constantli reaffirm sinc 1989 the facil wa indispens to franc s futur first for research into breeder reactor technolog subsequ for product of electr and final in 1994 for sub gener secondli nersa which oper superphoenix is own 51 percent by the edf 33 percent by itali s enel nation electr power board and 16 percent by germani s rwe rhine westphalian electr work shut down the reactor would requir a reimburs of the foreign partner who suppli some fr50 billion of the money the reactor ha alreadi consum no one yesterday wa abl to provid a precis figur but the partnership contract reportedli wa craft care enough that fr18 billion of that money probabl would have to be paid back the govern calcul that it would be less costli to complet the obligatori replac of the current breeder reactor core follow by the second isogener core in 1998 so the facil in the end can be use for research lastli one thing is sure given all the legal and administr hurdl ahead the reactor is not like to be back up to power befor the first half of 1995 veri probabl after the presidenti elect
