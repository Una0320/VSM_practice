articl type cso text a team of american scientist from livermor nation laboratori california under the leadership of r morrison have invent the new porou materi seagel with such a low densiti that the scientist say it would float away if it were not weigh down by the air trap in it microscop pore seagel which is biodegrad wa obtain by process agar a compon of brown alga kelp that is wide use as a thicken dure the prepar of food item such as ice cream it develop say that seagel is also suitabl for food and onli carbon dioxid and water are form dure it combust to obtain seagel agar is first dissolv in water and then an organ solvent and an emulsifi agent are ad to the mixtur which dispers the agar evenli throughout the liquid as tini droplet the liquid then set into a gel and is freez dri to obtain the final product depend on the condit of the process and the concentr of the initi product you can obtain a materi with differ properti depend on the individu applic from packag materi to slow releas capsul for medicin seagel should find the greatest applic with a densiti of 40 50 mg cm sup 3 thi compar with the 60 mg cm sup 3 densiti of balsa wood which is wide use as an insul materi in supertank and as a nois absorb materi in high speed train seagel can also replac polyurethan and polystyren styrofoam howev you need to take into account that the materi must be hermet seal becaus it dissolv in water at a temperatur of approxim 50c howev even thi properti can be use if seagel is use as a mold for cast becaus it permit it to be easili wash away to reveal the finish product new scientist 15 august 1992 vol 135 no 1834 p 19
