languag f p 105 latvian f articl type cso f p 106 articl by aisma coka head visa inspector immigr f wave continu door is wide open text i work at the visa depart of the depart of citizenship and immigr for the vidzem suburb and i would like to describ the problem i am face with everyday we shouldn t be pamper ani illus that the bill adopt at the first read of the citizenship law as develop by the latvian way and farmer union will save the latvian peopl protect them from further assimil into the mass of foreign immigr or promot the welfar of the nativ peopl of latvia in my opinion the most danger section of the bill is chapter 2 on natur quota which are to be determin everi year by the govern it look like we have miss the train onc again becaus at present just like dure the stagnat year of the recent past larg number of foreign citizen are arriv in latvia everi day some of them honest and dishonest are attempt to legal their stay in latvia use variou mean other who have been success in illeg cross the border or whose visa ha expir or whose permit to stay ha expir and have no ground for an extens instead of return to their place of perman resid remain in latvia illeg and are activ engag in privat busi activ the onli attempt at deal with the problem of foreign illeg live in latvia are be made by the depart of citizenship and immigr which wa creat two year ago other state institut such as the latvian polic for exampl who in accord with the law should be concern about expel violat of immigr regul from the state show no interest in thi matter a violat of the regul receiv an order to leav sign a statement that he will leav the territori of latvia within a seven day period and continu to walk to street of riga becaus the polic structur ha not creat a mechan through which thi matter could be follow up the procedur for issu a visa in accord with resolut 90 pass by the council of minist of the republ of latvia on februari 19 1993 ani citizen of latvia or ani foreign who is perman regist in latvia and whose passport contain the resid registri stamp and person code number ha the right to complet an invit form with which he can invit rel friend acquaint from other countri to visit of cours approxim one half of riga s resid are foreign who illeg enter latvia dure the soviet era and almost everyon of them ha a vast circl of friend and rel in the ci countri these foreign regist in latvia make up the major of our client it should be ad that recent for reason unknown the latvian mass media and along with thi also the public have popular the term perman resid which is use to describ citizen of the ussr live in latvia thi term is total mislead becaus such a concept is not contain in ani legisl act of the republ of latvia nor ha ani such categori of person been defin for whom such a term could be appli for legal purpos all of these peopl who from june 17 1940 up until juli 1 1992 illeg i e against the wish of the latvian citizenship bodi enter latvia to take up resid contain in their passport the inform that they are citizen or subject of the union of soviet socialist republ as we know for mani intern right question after 1991 the legal heir to the ussr is russia which is whi the bodi of peopl describ could be consid as citizen of russia of cours provid that they do not poss document prove citizenship of anoth countri in ani case these peopl have the statu of foreign in latvia not of perman resid furthermor when a latvian citizen or foreign regist in latvia ha complet the invit the visa depart confirm it and on the basi of thi document the latvian embassi abroad receiv entri visa for privat visit a privat visa is issu for a request period of time but not longer than for 3 month in a normal situat the foreign return home to hi perman countri of resid at the end of the privat visit unfortun the situat here is complet differ larg number of foreign enter latvia everi day and after expir of the visa intend for their visit attempt by whatev mean to gain the right to remain perman in latvia what is so attract about latvia for foreign it is our disorgan legisl and economi if the person who ha enter latvia is success in extend the visa or receiv a permit to stay he take advantag of the situat creat by the latvian govern in which immigr in term of econom activ are place in a consider more privileg situat than citizen of latvia and of cours the foreign who ha come here is veri quickli hire by some privat compani regist in latvia usual as a procur agent becaus the compani need peopl with a wide circl of acquaint or extens contact in russia and other ci countri these foreign continu travel to the ci countri back and forth bring in variou good and sell them in latvia for inflat price everi day larg number of foreign arriv in latvia for 3 month and can be rel easili divid into 4 group the first group is numer the largest and includ foreign who live in latvia and their spous who are citizen of other countri and arriv to join their famili and to remain to live in latvia although a major of those who come own apart and even hous in russia ci these person are ignor the law adopt by our state on foreign and those who are not citizen of ani countri who arriv and remain in the republ of latvia which went into effect on juli 1 1992 and the regul confirm by the council of minist on may 19 of thi year on the issu of permit for stay these legisl act state that permit for stay must be obtain by all foreign who wish to remain in latvia for more than 3 month and that these permit must be request from the latvian embassi or consular offic consul abroad the spous of foreign take an easier road of defianc again through falsif and lie that they are onli come for a visit they request an entri visa for 3 month and after spend a pleasant time within their famili circl they give notic that they are not go anywher becaus thi is where their wife or husband and children are it turn out that prior to arriv here the foreign left hi job and offici gave up the previou place of resid thu the poor person ha nowher to go the foreign are go around from pontiu to pilat to show that they are be discrimin against those who come here are not concern about unemploy nor about not know the state languag nor their lack of a legal mean of support the court system which should be protect the interest and right of citizen of the republ of latvia is involv with examin the complaint of those who have come here illeg foreign are now su not onli to receiv the resid registri stamp in their passport but also to legal the presenc of their spous in latvia i haven t heard about ani case be brought to court concern the activ of dishonest worker in the resid registri of the latgal or vidzem suburb who have receiv money to regist foreign as resid or citizen when in fact they are not qualifi to be regist as such the second is an elderli group consist of mother and father who have come from russia or the ci to visit their well situat children foreign regist in latvia and remain here to live also thi group of travel should have appli for permit of stay at the embassi befor come over but they have request visit visa for a period of 3 month and cross the latvian boarder afterward their children obtain from clinic and hospit either legal or fictiv doctor note which are not valid neither by the acknowledg of the commiss of physician nor by the signatur and stamp of the chief physician sometim it is a mysteri of how these peopl manag to come to latvia while suffer with such an array of diseas what is interest is that within 3 month their diseas and chronic condit have progress so sever that these peopl are prevent from leav it can be assum that these peopl are not concern with the problem of pension nor ani other type of hardship the children of these old peopl are persist in their fight to receiv the permit of stay the third group includ foreign who come to latvia supposedli on a visit but are actual here to engag in marriag and remain to live in latvia unfortun in accord with the present legisl a foreign who is in latvia on a visa can regist for marriag if someon who ha just come here marri a citizen of latvia in accord with the immigr law thi person can request and obtain a permit of stay for one year after which it can be extend to 4 year and after 5 year receiv a permit for perman stay veri often the marriag between person of foreign nation and citizen of latvia are fictiv conclud for the purpos of obtain a permit to stay in latvia obvious in a situat where the incom for the major of citizen of latvia border on minimum subsist citizen are forc to agre to such fictiv marriag in order to earn some addit incom in practic our worker have come upon the situat where one marri spous doe not know the other spous s date of birth residenti address or even the proper spell of the last name in mani case the spous retain their own last name the fourth group consist of polit and econom refuge from ci hot spot they join rel or friend here hide the true reason for come and often mention contract for work or studi in latvia as the reason for their propos stay in latvia in thi respect i would like to examin the riga civil aviat univers thi institut is a magnet for foreign thi alma mater attract a larg number of student from the transcaucasian republ who arriv here with their entir famili wive children father mother i cannot neglect to mention that there are also quit a few aspir student from the countri of the near and far east who dure the school semest attempt to regist marriag with citizen of latvia also fictiv marriag i would like to know what sort of specialist thi univers is train if even dure the studi period or immedi after complet studi they are regist compani in the republ of latvia busi registri with twenti or thirti dollar or so in their pocket to start busi activ it seem that no one at present can tell how mani firm and limit liabil compani are regist under the roof of thi univers what they are involv with and how thi benefit our nation in my opinion the site of thi univers could be use for the creation of the academi for state offici as discuss by the minist of reform and then there would be no need to evict the archiv from 15 raini boulevard which is involv with the gather and examin of parti and kgb document and final if the administr doe not adopt stronger entri regul if it doesn t adopt quota for issu permit for stay alreadi now then the uncontrol entri will continu of foreign who are hostil do not know the languag and do not understand the cultur and tradit and who are write to everi organ in the world about human right violat further confus the issu right of citizen and human right
