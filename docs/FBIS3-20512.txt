technolog comput and optic in addit the microminiatur of compon ha greatli downsiz the satellit while consider improv their function and the speed at which they can process data so their mission can be assign or re assign rapidli nro satellit oper on an ellipt track make one orbit around the earth everi 24 hour it on board photo facil can conduct target reconnaiss and monitor they can take close up pictur of certain special area and take pictur of wide region of the globe research can then look for interest content in the pictur today nro s bird are still stare at the strateg nuclear missil base in the variou countri of the commonwealth of independ state in the 1990 in addit to such tradit assign as check on the statu of implement the agreement to reduc militari facil the nro will assum some new one one of these is monitor the environ such natur disast data as forest fire volcan erupt flood earthquak etc will be monitor by satellit of nro or other inform organ and the data then sent to a group of specialist do environment research thi group consist of more than 50 specialist drawn from govern and local in 1991 the u s also set up an environment oper conting under the direct of the cia the demand for polit intellig increas daili exampl of thi are take pictur of the bo hei 3134 7815 pow camp close watch the spread of nuclear biolog and chemic weapon and ballist missil throughout the world and monitor the countless region conflict which might threaten u s interest nro ha receiv new order to assist the u s militari in rapidli dispatch troop outsid the u s s border in the futur more and more u s troop will be station at home so when a crisi situat occur intellig concern remot place must be collect in the shortest time possibl at such time there is no better way than use satellit nro doe not itself assign mission directli to it satellit thi task is undertaken by a special committe under the director of central intellig the photo need and use committe nro s daili assign come from thi committe h5 the nro staff h5 nro is respons for inform satellit and a complex network of ground facil at present the three u s militari branch employ a total of 38 militari satellit control station throughout the world the usaf oper 15 station most of them use to assist nro staff how mani peopl work for nro it is still a secret today it staff includ civilian technic personnel and engin who have undergon intens train but it also get a great deal of help from the usaf and it facil are all hidden in the usaf nro oper send control data to the satellit by comput make each satellit travel it requir path as well as control the satellit entri into space to take pictur unlik the nation secur agenc the huge u s commun intellig organ the nro doe not itself perform intellig analysi of the data it gather but it ha consum which do exampl of these are the cia the defens intellig agenc the state depart u s militari intellig organ etc nro personnel are veri enthusiast about their work they oper complic machin with thousand of compon and part even a slight mistak can have seriou consequ as a satellit could go off track the pentagon s budget ha been slash continu over the past eight year and estim are that nro s budget ha been cut to 5 to 6 billion dollar in the next sever year it is estim that the number of reconnaiss satellit will be reduc by 25 percent although more advanc and longer live new satellit will to a certain degre compens for some of the reduct but the budget reduct mean that consum may not abl to get the intellig they want on time
