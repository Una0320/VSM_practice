to china s scienc and technolog polici white paper on scienc and technolog no 5 h5 new materi h5 new materi refer to materi that have been recent develop or which are now be develop that have superior properti or special function inform energi resourc and materi are consid the three big pillar of modern civil the gener and develop of a new technolog are often determin by new materi and new technic breakthrough may aris after the birth of sever new materi and have a major impact on industri structur and social life new materi are a field of extrem vigor develop at present and for the materi that creat entir new concept such as superlattic metast state non crystallin materi and so on besid their own appli valu they also open up new realm for scientif develop thu new materi are an import part of high and new technolog and all of the world s industri develop nation have treat new materi as an import realm for preferenti develop the primari characterist of new materi and their gener are a high degre of technolog intens rapid renew and replac high r amp d input power secreci high product ad valu intens intern properti in product and the market and a decis role of product qualiti and special properti in the market their overal develop direct are toward compound structur and integr function the requir for materi includ light weight thin fine high puriti and so on acceler china s develop of new materi reduc our lag behind advanc intern level and further meet china s econom develop and nation defens construct requir is an extrem import task that we face h5 i develop strategi and object h5 h5 a develop strategi h5 from the import statu and intern develop trend of new materi and in integr with china s concret condit we should adopt the principl of limit object key breakthrough combin track with innov the guid ideolog is first on a foundat of adher primarili to relianc our own effort and reli primarili on our own strength and resourc characterist do r amp d concern new materi establish and develop china s new materi system and engag in intern cooper through a varieti of rout to absorb advanc technolog and inform and acceler the cours of develop second new materi develop must emphas integr of materi scienc with materi engin and must have clear applic object and develop must be close integr with appli develop and applic third the develop of new materi must both guarante militari industri requir as well as make major effort to develop new materi that are urgent need by key state project and that have signific technic econom benefit fourth we must focu on deploy in depth in r amp d work which mean do intens r amp d on new materi that we alreadi have or that we urgent need while at the same time focus on make arrang in a focus and step by step manner for new materi with long term signific that are requir by high and new technolog fifth reinforc basic research and appli basic research on new materi open up new product varieti and expand the scope of their util the goal in develop new materi is to make a contribut to the develop of china s economi toward a benefit type s amp t vanguard type and intensif dure the last part of thi centuri and the earli part of the next centuri while at the same time satisfi the requir associ with militari industri thu we must give prefer to r amp d on electron and optoelectron materi high perform composit high perform ceram new type of metal materi new type of polym materi non crystallin materi superconduct materi function gradient materi and artifici intellig materi and to autom product technolog intellig process technolog and other modern materi scienc and technolog for new materi h5 b strateg object h5 year 2000 1 suppli the metal inorgan non metal organ polym composit materi and other key and match new materi in a time manner for the develop of china s strateg and tactic weapon to guarante the requir of nation defens modern 2 provid all type of key new materi requir for the develop of the state s key project construct especi in the energi resourc commun electron industri and other area and base the primari basic materi for nuclear power plant microelectron technolog electron comput etc on domest sourc 3 for sever new type of materi with broad develop prospect such as optoelectron materi composit fine ceram new metal materi separ membran materi non crystallin materi superconduct materi optic fiber and other area make breakthrough with key technolog develop new product varieti and achiev the applic stage 4 for those new materi where we alreadi have a substanti foundat and that also have import technic econom benefit use the develop of industri technolog and appli research to expand product varieti stabil qualiti reduc cost and for sever industri strive to attain a direct valu of output of more than 27 billion yuan from new materi by the year 2000 5 strengthen basic research applic for materi develop materi design at differ level with
