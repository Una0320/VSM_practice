languag f p 105 french f articl type bfn f p 106 interview with raymond kendal interpol secretari gener f by vincent jauvert place and date not given drug the confess of interpol chief text jauvert you are veri pessimist at present kendal ye the situat ha deterior enorm in the earli 1970 s when i head the interpol s narcot divis there wa no real drug problem in europ traffick wa essenti direct toward the unit state what is the situat now at the begin of 1994 in pari london frankfurt or rome in all the great european citi the drug market is boom with an ever increas number of drug addict thi is whi i am sound the alarm make an appeal to politician and say bewar if we continu fight against drug abus in the way we have for the past 20 year we will definit lose the battl perhap we have alreadi lost it for that matter jauvert can you suggest ani solut kendal there is onli one possibl solut do everyth in our power to reduc consumpt our ruler must final acknowledg thi whatev effort the law enforc agenc make drug produc and dealer will continu to thrive as long as there are million of consum in our countri the onli way of break the market is to make demand drop dramat jauvert what about hit the produc countri even harder kendal you can tri to of cours recent a french politician even said that they should be attack militarili if necessari jauvert it wa charl pasqua interior minist am i right kendal you are say so jauvert wa it not a good idea kendal let us be realist let us take for exampl the case of medellin cartel s boss pablo escobar will the fact that he wa elimin chang anyth at all no it may perhap have a psycholog effect on other drug dealer but as to the rest we know for some consider time that hi cartel ha been replac by that of cali in other word the econom and social condit in the produc countri are such that it is nonsens to believ that peopl there are go to depriv themselv of the financi benefit deriv from produc coca opium or cannabi of cours we must tri to convinc them one way or the other but we should not expect signific result in the short or even in the long term on that front jauvert what if we help those countri convert their product to coffe wheat rice kendal we must do so obvious but there again let us be realist and look at the result in thailand for exampl a convers polici ha now been implemet for over 15 year but thi did not prevent a heroin product boom from take place in the golden triangl no that is not how the problem will be solv jauvert nor do you believ it will take us ani further to concentr our effort on the drug trade itself and therefor on repress measur kendal no everi year we are seiz greater and greater quantiti of drug and arrest an ever increas number of dealer howev at the same time the amount of narcot avail in our countri is increas therefor let us continu by all mean to crack down on dealer but there again let us not hope for miracl jauvert not even if the mean of repress were consider increas kendal let us imagin that we doubl the financi resourc avail for the narcot brigad will we therebi multipli by two the seizur i do not think so we will get to know the problem better we will develop what is today call crimin intellig that is to say inform techniqu on organ crime thi is import but how can it improv the root problem name consumpt a few year ago the ameriacan tri to determin the ratio between seizur and the amount of drug actual avail well then accord to thi studi in certain countri the ratio is as low as 5 percent and the maximum is 25 percent now research have estim that it would be necessari to seiz 40 percent or even 50 percent accord to a recent investig in order to have a real impact on the market that is in order to reduc consumpt we are veri far from these figur the traffick stock are gigant in other word even by increas the repress mean consider we would not achiev a signific impact on drug addict jauvert it might also be possibl to intensifi the fight against the launder of narco dollar which ha becom veri topic over the past few month kendal it must be done of cours but i am afraid that thi new hobbi hors may lead us to lose sight of the real problem combat the launder of money is not an end in itself it is onli a mean for stop drug dealer and one which is not let us be frank about it particularli effect let us take for exampl the bcci affair the greatest launder oper ever to be discov what did it come to after four year work after mobil a huge number of polic onli three peopl have been prosecut for launder 14 million dollar now the annual turnov for drug deal is estim at 350 billion dollar about 100 of which would appear to be invest in the intern financi circuit fourteen million out of 350 billion thi is littl more than drop of water in the sea jauvert sinc then special brigad have been set up to combat money launder kendal so much the better but what resourc do they have at their dispos in franc for exampl the team compris some twenti peopl ask them how mani case they are abl to crack in a year you will be surpris at the ridicul small figur they will quot you will object that their personnel could be increas thi would of cours be posit but it would not chang the root problem in the least there is in our countri consider demand for narcot and as long as thi is the case you can rest assur peopl will continu to produc drug deal in them and will continu to launder money jauvert in your view then thi demand can be reduc kendal in ani case we should tri to until now there have been few effort in thi direct politician speak of war on drug addict and they are right becaus the futur of our democraci is at stake nevertheless let us compar the defens budget to that avail for special center for drug addict do the resourc avail say in franc or britain exceed the price of a singl fighter plane if thi were so i would be veri surpris to learn it the swede howev have shown that when a genuin polit will is there demand can be curtail for some year now they have been spend consider sum of money in inform campaign and aid program aim at drug addict as a result consumpt ha drop dramat i am not say that the swedish model can be transplant anywher but it should be studi more close jauvert whi are western govern in your opinion be so inact kendal i have often ask myself that question and i have found three reason in the first place develop an effect prevent and help program for drug addict is unquestion a difficult task we know the motiv of drug dealer but it is much more difficult to pinpoint the social and psycholog reason that lead a person to heroin even those who are supposedli specialist in the field do not agre on the most effect form of treatment secondli such program are extrem expens and onli lead to posit result after a number of year even as long as a decad the third reason result from the first if they have to invest resourc in combat drug addict politician prefer to concentr their effort on repress the result of which are more readili perceiv by public opinion howev if we took our time result would follow consid what happen in the case of tobacco follow year of campaign to sensit public opinion consumpt final drop whi should it be imposs to do the same in the case of drug addict jauvert to curtail demand you advoc decrimin drug abus whi kendal becaus regard consum as offend serv no use purpos in fact it is even danger a convict person discov a cultur in prison which may make him becom someth he wa not when he first came in name a crimin note howev that i am speak of decrimin drug abus not of legal it i believ drug addict must not be put in jail but rather forc to undergo treatment in a special medic center jauvert are you in favor then of decrimin the use of heroin and cocain as well as cannabi kendal ye medic doctor have muddl the issu for a long time by tri to draw a differ between soft and hard drug as a matter of fact we now know that both are toxic product the substanc contain in cannabi thc is hazard for the brain it neg effect last longer than those of alcohol for exampl so whi should the two type of drug be treat differ jauvert you said that the polic should be abl to forc drug addict to undergo treatment in fact thi is now almost the case in franc with the so call therapeut injunct although few peopl are awar of thi onc arrest drug user as oppos to peddler can theoret choos between treatment or prison kendal ye but thi law is not be enforc through a lack of mean how mani place are avail in the special center that can provid treatment for drug addict ten 20 time as mani would be requir in order to be effect throughout europ the state ha so far reli too heavili on chariti organ howev it is up to the state now to take the initi on the other hand thi choic between treatment or inprison seem to me to be inappropri prison is in no case an effect solut drug addict must be treat even forc to do so and doctor must be given the mean to help them jauvert forc how kendal i do not know it is the specialist who must decid jauvert do you think doctor should be allow to prescrib substitut product such as methadon or even heroin kendal whi not if result can be achiev in thi way i have onli one reserv substitut product should not replac one form of depend with anoth for ani great length of time but onc again thi is a matter for specialist jauvert as a matter of fact a few day ago the highest medic author in the unit state announc it wa favor toward legal pure and simpli kendal i am total oppos to such a view jauvert whi kendal simpli becaus legal drug would automat lead to an increas in consumpt do you know whi more and more peopl are in favor of legal becaus through lazi or ignor the phenomenon ha been trivial when 400 kilo of canabi are seiz in calai who care nevertheless if tomorrow a chemic plant dump toxic product into a river and kill some fish that will stir up a scandal drug dealer do that everi day by place product that are highli toxic to human on the market and nobodi say a word jauvert yet alcohol and cigarett are sold freeli kendal so what two toxic product are alreadi social accept is thi a reason to add two more to the list what els should be legal next crack lsd at what age jauvert it is also argu that legal drug consumpt would reduc the incid of crime kendal for a while perhap but did the end of prohibit caus the mafia or gangster to disappear in the unit state of cours not dealer will find other sourc of profit jauvert nevertheless thi solut is be advoc by policemen in mani countri kendal true i have recent discuss the subject with some british colleagu a few year ago they would have said an outright no to decrimin wherea today some scotland yard offici are publicli pose the question of legal i understand their viewpoint a policeman is there to enforc the law now the law on drug abus are flout a thousand time a day so they ask themselv whi not abolish them it is a legitim feel even if i do not share it jauvert so you believ that the moment ha come to start a major debat kendal ye let everyon clearli express their opinon today european are veri sensit to ethic and individu respons issu let us take advantag of thi befor it is too late
