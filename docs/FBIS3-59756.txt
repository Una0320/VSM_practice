on mot research institut thi tabl also includ research item base on budget appropri in lump sum for other ministri and agenc and special account below we will explain those item that warrant special mention center on new research item h3 1 research on structur safeti evalu to accommod lighter weight ship h3 from now on the demand for larger and faster ship is expect to increas and variou type of high speed ship are be develop in japan and other countri with that the current safeti standard for light structur ship are be revis by the intern maritim organ imo and safeti standard for the new high speed ship are be studi in japan as well thi research involv investig structur safeti which is close relat to the safeti of high speed ship becaus the exist design standard are not applic to some part of the new type of ship necessit safeti evalu by mean of direct calcul the mot will investig weight set method structur analysi method and strength evalu method for that clarifi the necessari and suffici condit for ensur safeti and studi method of safeti inspect base on actual ship measur h3 2 research on aircraft monitor method for shorter vertic control interv h3 with the increas in the volum of air traffic it is expect that altitud of 29 000 ft and higher 1 000 ft vertic interv will have to be adopt in order to effect use air space with that there ha arisen a need for set up a system that monitor detect and exclud aircraft whose altitud mainten error exce a certain valu thi effort involv research the feasibl configur etc of a monitor system for the purpos of establish technolog for monitor aircraft altitud mainten error h3 3 research on advanc earthquak resist design method for seasid facil to withstand strong earthquak directli beneath tokyo h3 recent the increas probabl of a power earthquak occur directli beneath tokyo ha been indic and the investig of how tokyo s seasid facil will hold up in such a scenario ha becom an urgent issu accordingli the mot will conduct research to infer earthquak engin characterist the dynam behavior of structur and foundat that would result from such an earthquak the amount of structur deform in such a disast etc in order to improv the level of earthquak resist design method for seasid facil h3 4 research on technolog for evalu the safeti of advanc urban railway transit system h3 the introduct of advanc transit system that use new technolog in urban rail line is thought to be veri effect in solv problem such as congest dure commut hour and the longer amount of time peopl spend on train howev there have been hardli ani technic evalu of these advanc transit system and there ha been littl progress in make those system practic therefor safeti evalu technolog must be improv so that it can handl the new technolog and therebi facilit the introduct of these transit system thi research involv investig technolog for evalu transit safeti brake perform and train oper secur system and gather data on the safeti of advanc transit system h3 5 research on advanc technolog for predict global warm h3 owe to the increas in atmospher co lt inf gt 2 lt inf gt caus by fossil fuel consumpt global scale warm ha becom an intern issu warm predict socio econom affect and measur for cope with global warm are be investig in the ipcc becaus there will be an abund of observ data in the late 1990 from program such as toga and woce thi research involv develop technolog for comprehens analyz that data maintain grid point climat data and develop atmospher ocean coupl model of the entir globe h3 6 research on method of platform test ab equip larg vehicl h3 although regul mandat ab anti lock brake system instal in combin vehicl and larg buse are enforc test of ab perform dure usag have not been implement and onli the electron control section of ab system are inspect with the increas in ab equip vehicl from now on mandat period inspect necessit the develop of platform test devic with which perform test equival to road test can be reproduc for the purpos of confirm the state of ab oper dure brake and the result safeti thi research involv investig the perform requir for platform test devic formul the specif of and trial produc a devic and obtain materi on test method h5 7 research on the applic of no h5 lt inf gt x lt inf gt reduct technolog to medium weight gasolin tank truck expens for nation laboratori test research on pollut prevent etc countermeasur against diesel exhaust are urgent need becaus environment level of no lt inf gt 2 lt inf gt are not achiev near major urban roadway and float particul caus health problem such measur howev are technolog difficult if the kind of technolog use in passeng car for deal with exhaust ga can be appli to medium weight gasolin tank truck that would be an effect way to prevent air pollut in the futur thi research effort involv studi ideal no lt inf gt x lt inf gt reduct technolog that can be appli in medium weight gasolin tank truck catalyt convert rhodium etc measur for improv the durabl of catalyst and other such technolog for practic use h3 8 research on advanc method of identifi trace amount of lubric oil expens for nation laboratori test research on pollut prevent etc h3 after fuel oil the most preval leakag from bilg into the ocean is gener a mixtur of fuel oil and lubric oil as time pass the low boil point compon evapor and mostli lubric oil remain but with analysi method up until now identifi lubric oil had been difficult in recent year howev the function of analysi equip have improv and the analysi of high boil point compon in lubric oil ha becom possibl thi research involv investig method of analyz those compon then combin those with exist method to establish a way to identifi bilg and lubric oil with a high degre of accuraci h3 9 research on technolog for util human percept and sensori function in nuclear power plant oper expens for nuclear power test research at nation laboratori h3 in the oper of nuclear power plant and other such larg scale system convey plant inform to the oper through physic model is effect but the manner in which the inform is convey to oper must be compat with human percept and sensori function for that reason provid inform that is select with consider for human capabl and characterist is import in thi effort research will investig way to convey inform so that whatev is current happen in a plant can be recogn with the five human sens the purpos of which is to accur convey autom black box plant inform oper method base on the inform that is convey and way for oper to be abl to sens the effect of oper on the plant h3 10 basic research on foundat measur for nuclear power facil in coastal region expens for nuclear power test research at nation laboratori h3 becaus harbor are import as
