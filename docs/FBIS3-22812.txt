languag f p 105 japanes f articl type bfn text the power reactor and nuclear fuel corpor prnfc ha compil the result of it studi of the actinid recycl process a process by which fast breeder reactor fbr can burn plutonium retriev from spent nuclear fuel togeth with transuranium element which are the byproduct of reprocess plutonium as it is now technic possibl to use as reactor core fuel a mixtur of up to 5 percent transuranium element with plutonium prospect have brighten for the practic use of the process wherebi an fbr can burn transuranium element gener by six light water reactor of the same scale as the fbr the prnfc plan to step up research effort includ the start of irradi test thi summer use transuranium element at joyo an experiment fbr the prnfc set up a simul at a monju reactor a prototyp fbr for reactor core fuel it use an approxim 5 percent mixtur or about 500 kilogram of three type of transuranium element neptunium americium and curium in combin with two ton of plutonium and about seven ton of uranium the test suggest that increas the mixtur of transuranium element to more than 5 percent advers affect reactor core perform it can for exampl lower the melt point of the nuclear fuel in the simul it wa found that a yearli averag of about 40 kilogram of transuranium element can be elimin use the actinid recycl process the spent nuclear fuel result from thi process can be reprocess separ bred plutonium from radioact wast to produc new fuel the reprocess plutonium can then be combin with the necessari amount of uranium and transuranium element to supplement those elimin in the initi process thi new fuel can then be burn under the same condit again accord to the prnfc a 1 million kilowatt class light water reactor annual gener an averag of 40 50 kilogram of transuranium element of which neptunium and americium account for close to 50 percent each while curium account for about 5 percent although it ha been found that neptunium and americium can be effici elimin with fbr s curium on the other hand ha been found to increas three fold in volum in order to grasp actual physic properti of transuranium element when they disintegr irradi test use import sampl will be conduct with the joyo moreov there are plan to begin experi with americium base nuclear fuel possibl in fiscal year 1998
