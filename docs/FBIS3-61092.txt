such individu make to the growth of our peopl s number tatimov inde it is true that a great caravan of migrat ha begun to flow into our countri our kinsmen were forc to leav their countri far behind throw their fate to the wind they encount oppress from conserv at the time of the civil war were annihil by leftist persecut at the time of goloshchekin and were alarm by racist oppress dure the era of coloni for a time we blacken the reput of these innoc but now a just polit evalu is be assign and we are not be spare in our help to all of those express a desir to return to their nativ land in spite of the fact that our sovereign countri is itself bare on it feet thi process is go forward with the direct support of the govern and the presid i am one of those directli respons for begin what is in truth the last great migrat for it proper manag and for it timeli the ministri of labor of foreign affair and of intern affair are involv with such problem as the settlement of our kinsmen return from abroad one in three of our kinsmen in mongolia that is to say more than 50 000 have return we may say that the caravan ha start and ha taken the road thi great caravan will be continu from still other countri kazakh live in tajikistan becam refuge last year due to the effect of the civil war start by religi extremist our presid ha given them great assist food cloth and drug have been deliv by special train some 6 000 of the 9 000 kazakh in tajikistan have been evacu simultan on the train some 1 200 famili have been resettl in southern kazakhstan oblast primarili in zhetisay rayon at the time of the 1990 osh incid i wa in qorghantob oblast in qolkhozabat rayon at that time i advis our kinsmen in that area to return quickli to their countri most listen to what i had to say but some seem to want to continu to think about it resourc were adequ to evacu them those remain behind who did not migrat regret it and in the end had to be remov involuntarili at the time of the civil war thu there were also loss in gener it is a good thing to listen to expert think about what to do in such question new focus for migrat have emerg by the end of the year a total of 7 000 person 1 000 famili from iran and 400 famili from turkey will migrat a new migrat depart is now carri out preparatori work the head of thi depart ghaziz yesmuqanov pamir kameldiyev and nurlan ralqymzhanov are do a great deal of work first of all they are plan to evacu militari refuge who desert at the time of the war in afghanistan thi is becaus they are citizen of no countri lack employ suffer from poor live standard and for that reason should be return to kazakhstan quickli the proverb state it is difficult to begin a trek if we understand how to be human by creat favor condit for those come for the first time and for those now leav i think that the 15 000 kazakh still remain in iran and the 25 000 in turkey will want to return to their homeland our butter heal from iran will primarili find a place to live in warm southern kazakhstan oblast the reason is that we cannot send those come from warm climat to place where the weather is sever they might not becom acclimat there there is someth which must be said here we are predispos not to like but to hate kazakh instead of take our countrymen who have come from foreign countri into our midst and make them our kinsmen we accus them by say oh are we to take thi to mean that you have not forgotten kazakh custom you say one thing and do anoth we call those return from mongolia mongol and those come from turkey turk those come from europ we accus for their inabl to speak kazakh at all there are now those who assign guilt becaus we accept some peopl who do no work at all instead of act like thi and look for problem i can say that if abov all we make it possibl for them to support themselv and help them to get use to the new countri everyth will be fine i do not know whether or not you understand my dear when i call our foreign countrymen butter heal i have my reason for call them thi what have your kazakh not experienc dure the time of the lake alqa flight dzungarian invas they put one foot behind the other in the snow and becam white heal dure the era of coloni they suffer oppress as yellow heal dure the time of the civil war they wander as black heal dure the time of goloshchekin they suffer slaughter as red heal there is the wise teach of our forefath that there is a good side to everi difficulti in fact there must be good side to each of these four difficulti the first good side i think is that our kinsmen who have gone to foreign countri have return as butter heal they will make a contribut to the flourish of our nation with their work good honor intent and experi in the school of life it is well known that butter heal immigr are those who have made countri such as america australia argentina new zealand and canada flourish and develop similarli three million of the butter heal resid in foreign countri will make a major contribut to the flourish and enrich of our sovereign nation for that reason we must put our white tablecloth on the tabl befor them and we must assembl them togeth in our black yurt call kazakhstan we have mention the migrat which we have recent organ we have observ other disorgan element migrat there are also mani who have return to their nativ countri with their own resourc or by forc thu 20 000 peopl came last year from russia 14 000 from uzbekistan and 6 000 from other republ 40 000 in all all of these migrant will have a favor influenc on the exhaust ethno demograph shape of our republ someth els which i would like to mention i think that god will and if the world doe not end a new campaign will begin in the new futur to move gradual local peopl remain behind in the ecolog disast of the aral to northern oblast and rayon which are ecolog healthi but are still weak in their ethno demograph structur thi would compris first and foremost aral qazali and shalqar rayon which remain in the disast area later if possibl we will have to take up the question of return our kinsmen live in karakalpakistan to the motherland that migrat would occupi a particular place in the ethno demograph develop of kazakhstan accord to my calcul if we were to move at least half of the 600 000 of our karakalpak kinsmen live in the vicin of the aral in an organ manner to the recent master region that alon would chang the ethno demograph shape of northern kazakhstan in our favor in a fundament way qurmanqulqyzi children were onc mani in the famili of kazakh who knew how to repeat the proverb a hous with children is a bazaar a hous without children a dri graveyard it ha been said that the number of larg famili ha been on the declin in recent year what kind of evid can you offer in regard to thi tatimov thi question is one which is dear to my heart and well known to me sinc i understand the question well i have been endeavor to instil demograph thought and tradit attitud into the mind of kazakh women fact from my own research are offer in my book tale of the peopl or number and thought and in my recent publish eighth book kazakh world how mani kazakh are there when and where have kazakh been driven out when and where have they been oppress shot these two book must still have not reach reader the first copi of the first book were put into the pocket of those attend the world confer of kazakh the book is still not on sale and may never be on sale the second book ha onli recent been publish with a run of 60 000 from the ata mura press head by an intellectu call muqtar qulmukhametuli for that reason let me repeat these fact again for kazakh women from what is in thi book accord to the 1926 censu each marri kazakh women had on the averag 10 children after that the birth rate abat the reason for thi were the deterior of the health of the peopl hunger and russian settlement it could be said that the russian had a role russian women at that time too took good care of themselv and did not have larg famili wa not thi characterist of their begin to infect kazakh women in 1959 the number of birth per woman had fallen to seven howev sinc infant mortal decreas along with the birthrat a demograph wave a new explos appear the reason wa that wherea women had previous born 10 children while onli one or two or surviv now onli one or two of seven children die and five six live to matur thu a demograph explos wa creat thi wa a gener process take place worldwid kazakhstan made it own contribut the demograph wave last until the 1970 accord to 1989 censu inform the high birthrat of recent time had strongli declin and we were near a three child threshold therebi we approach a level of two children in the citi and of four children in rural area thi must give kazakh women a great deal to think about in particular the market place wa exert a neg influenc while the birthrat continu to declin the number of children given birth by kazakh mother in absolut term stay more or less the same the fact that thi year the number of children given birth to by kazakh women in the republ will be in the vicin of 202 000 205 000 is onli becaus the demograph structur of our peopl is young the reason is that those born dure the period of the demograph explos now have famili and are bring children into the world i emphas in an interview given to the newspap zha alash the need to struggl for a fourth child the reason is that if the first child is a son it replac the father and if a girl the mother and the second child simpli replac the parent the third child compens for our variou defici those not marri and old maid therebi we maintain our number at a set level it is the fourth child which provid growth i myself am the tenth and last child of my father and the last child of my mother the fourth son but for such kazakh characterist of my parent i would not have come into the world in 1940 just befor the war dure the last difficulti of a time of persecut if that wa so who would be now talk to you here about demograph tatimov laugh loudli when he said thi qurmanqulqyzi one of the question which you have rais and which ha gain the attent of the nation dure the last two or three year is get one or two children from women who are still young but have not found mate for thi purpos they becom junior wive or second wive to men who alreadi have senior wive there are mani who are against thi have you now chang your support for thi polici tatimov no thi is a veri complic question it should not be oversimplifi in thi manner a kazakh ha said the most difficult struggl are the struggl for land and the struggl of widow howev today the struggl of those old ladi must be more difficult than ani it would not be too much to devot an entir interview just to that question let me first of all tell who these old ladi are and provid an explan that is becaus some go on about old ladi old ladi but do not know who they are old ladi are those of the femal sex who are over 25 but not yet 50 who have never marri never establish a household and have had no children in develop countri an express like kazakh old ladi is altogeth absent kazakh women fear gossip and remain in their inappropri state today they cannot extric themselv from their dilemma my advic is as follow let us get a child or so from them all thi sever advic may seem a littl coars to other but life prove that it is correct is not becom a mother and love a child better than live alon when we realiz that most of today s old ladi are offic worker we know that they live in front of peopl for that reason they fear malici word in my opinion it is crimin for them to wast their live becaus peopl gossip there are at present 110 000 old ladi among the kazakh and if they had onli one two children thi would bring a gener of 220 000 into the world just like the proverb a voraci hors is no good hors to be call an old ladi is no honor for a woman the word of the peopl are one thing the law of life are anoth there is no need to issu a special law on the take of two wive it would be proper if thi question were decid with the particip of the mosqu all we have to do is to drop articl 208 of the law on marriag and the famili it is state there that take two wive is forbidden accord to my research no one ha been brought to trial on the basi of that law sinc the war that is to say thi law is entir ineffect thu we must drop a dead law which no longer function after that as the russian say we can do anyth which is not forbidden i know that some peopl do not agre with my view on old ladi that is to be expect everyon will not agre with everi suggest that is made there will be propon and oppon of everi innov that is life i know well that when i first made thi suggest that there would be opposit and that my oppon would primarili be those women support a fals emancip who are liter and who think themselv equal to their husband some time even superior moreov they inde came out against me and we were unabl to cast light on thi vital question onli when thi ha been done can we cautious approach thi question as imparti possibl and in a seriou manner it would be proper for us to look at the issu in such a way that no one is insult and no one s feel are hurt those in favor of polygami in order to back up their posit make the point that kazakh formerli practic polygami and that thi ancestr custom must be renew i am a support of limit polygami but have no desir to present decept evid in support of my view as shown by the 1897 censu onli three four percent of the kazakh men of the time had two wive and those with three wive were one in a thousand thu if our women who have remain unmarri becom second wive to around four five percent of all kazakh men the problem would therebi gradual be solv qurmanqulqyzi it would seem as if anoth of the idea which you have advanc your thought on recogn mother of larg famili ha found express in the presidenti edict on thi topic thu you are make plan for the carri out of your suggest relat to the presidenti edict when will the day aris when the appropri mother get golden prize and silver prize in honor these mother will onli the number of children brought into the world be consid or will there be other measur as well tatimov inde i am make plan it will not be long until such prize are award competit for these gold and silver prize honor are be announc nomin are be review but no select have been made the golden prize will be given to mother who have born and rais eight or more children in my view the level should be reduc to seven sinc the number of mother with larg famili is on the declin and the number seven is a lucki number for the kazakh the word suffici zhettik and adequaci zhetistik have come from the word for seven zheti and the idea of offer seven of someth of prepar seven cake have arisen from that superstit the silver prize will be given to distinguish mother who have rais five or more children howev i have express the view that mother with three children or more should also be includ among the rank of those with larg famili likewis i have offer the suggest that if there are distinguish mother who rais and educ still more children the presid himself or the premier or the governor of the appropri oblast or rayon should award them a special prize to be sure mother who have born mani children but who have not educ them properli or even abandon them will not receiv such honor far from it qurmanqulqyzi mr tatimov pleas do not hold it against me if i seem disrespect and ask a question that is too direct you to be sure are one of those interest in the growth of you countri and in thi regard have come out against artifici abort howev who know better than women the soul and circumst of women for exampl if a husband s incom is inadequ to rais and educ five six children who gain from the bear of children who crowd togeth for a miser hand to mouth exist in addit an era of total destitut such as the present and the ecolog environ are have a consider neg impact upon the health of mother everi other pregnant women is anem it is well known that women with thi diseas do not bear healthi children thu it would seem appropri that the decis in thi area to have children or limit a famili belong to the famili and to women themselv tatimov inde i am oppos to abort you are correct the decis to limit or not limit the number of children is someth which concern husband and wife equal first the woman and then the man mani women do not take into consider their husband s view on thi question thi is the reason for the increas in the number of abort and the use of the loop the man must also particip in determin famili size i think that it would be appropri in the futur to introduc a law that marri women must have their husband s permiss to get an abort or to have a loop instal in particular smart women too often think of their own concern and are have a neg influenc on our demograph to give number wherea 204 000 kazakh were born in kazakhstan in 1992 dure the same year 100 000 abort were perform in the republ 50 000 loop were instal and variou other thing were done to prevent the birth of children as a result more than half of the children brought to life by kazakh women some 250 000 were elimin the number of children who could have been born but were not born exceed the number of children born we are not say that famili should not be limit each mother should be concern about her health howev the fact that 300 000 children of kazakh women capabl of bear children were voluntarili suffoc and reject make my insid seeth is that islam thi leav asid humanitarian consider last year 47 000 kazakh die some 300 000 children were born and even with the death of 55 000 our peopl could have gain not 157 000 but 245 000 we we ourselv thu extinguish a substanti 88 000 of our natur increas there are the lament black old woman black old man black child leav their sorrow alon who is express sorrow for the child never born and who feel the loss there is no artist to produc a song about thi or to write word the greatest of sorrow is the sorrow of the unborn child i miss them although i am onli a demograph my word to my daughter in law were when she had had a child and wa in difficulti becaus of it my kazakh it is said each child ha it own fate there is a kazakh folk say if one extra lamb is born there will be one more plot of grass i am against limit famili with the excus that as the market place ha gain so much power we cannot support them let me consid each child separ the first child is alway born for the father and replac him the second child is born to replac the mother the third child is born to compens for defici the fourth child is necessari for demograph law for growth if the fifth child come to life it doe so for the peopl the sixth child is for the fatherland for the flourish of our sovereign countri the seventh child that is an honor number and word which fulfil the desir of heaven when the eighth child is born the spirit are satisfi when the ninth child is born it satisfi the muslim religion the will of allah if you say that we are nine children in our home then your mother and father aqqaysha and qurmanqul are person who have satisfi the will of heaven in the blue sky of the spirit of the dark earth and of allah the onli god i would like to say thank and express my satisfact to your mother in particular and thereaft to your father for increas and make flourish the number of the kazakh as for anemia thi diseas is due to dietari and vitamin defici for that reason slaughter a sheep and give it to a woman who ha just given birth just as one doe befor she give birth as a qalzha special food for pregnant women it would be appropri if the place where she work or if she doe not work the place her husband work or the kolkhoz or sovkhoz where the famili live were to provid it i think thi is someth for local governor to think about qurmanqulqyzi let us return to the question of old ladi discuss abov there are mani unmarri men in my view it would seem proper for thi issu to find it own proper solut without some special state polici what new fact and suggest do you have to offer about thi tatimov some have complain that i talk a lot about the problem of old ladi there are lot of old bachelor whi not pick on them the reason is that women are the fundament demograph support it is they who increas or decreas the number of peopl for demographi if a man remain unmarri with no shame at the word of great if he is impot thi mean noth sinc anoth man will take hi place howev if a woman doe not marri or remain steril or die anoth woman cannot replac her the posit of everi woman is special in demograph if a man die thi is just one minu for demographi howev when a woman leav the world we must produc sever minus if the woman is young thi mean that four children 12 grandchildren at three each from the children 24 great grandchildren from the grandchildren at two each will not be born for thi reason in demographi the problem of 110 000 old ladi is more of a problem than 44 000 old bachelor the reason for the increas in the number of old bachelor is the worsen of ecolog condit in the republ some of the children be born in the environment disast area suffer from impot when we spoke of old bachelor we refer to male who have never marri between the age of 30 and 55 recent i collect statist throughout the republ on those assault and kill one anoth look at thi inform it wa primarili men who assault and kill one anoth their number were three time more than the women i wonder if the increas in the number of peopl kill each other wa due to impot thi is onli a hypothesi we must look at the question more deepli among women there are also uninterest women frigid women that is women who are not interest in men howev they do not kill each other for that reason howev impot is a great grief for men i have state abov that old ladi cannot get out of their difficulti on their own but i repeat that in addit to the state the mosqu should becom involv in thi question howev our mosqu still take a mistaken view of them i call thi their social impot qurmanqulqyzi mr tatimov are there question which concern you more than other just now as a person who love hi countri tatimov tomorrow i will leav on a trip to koshetaw my purpos in go there is to carri out preparatori work for transfer there the migrat depart establish under the ministri of labor the reason as i have alreadi state is that the northern oblast are still weak demograph for that reason we have decid to move thi depart to kokshetaw with the aim of prevent such manifest as separat harm our young nation as we chang the ethno demograph shape of the oblast after that i will be in that citi to carri out public opinion research on move the capit to aqmola as a member of the nation keng on state polici and as a specialist in demograph scienc i will be veri much involv with make specif suggest qurmanqulqyzi thank you
