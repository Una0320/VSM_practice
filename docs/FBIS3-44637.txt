socialist market economi need macroeconom regul and control how to carri out macroeconom regul and control peopl do not have complet ident viewpoint on these question henc mani of the problem occur in the current macroeconom manag have someth to do with thi situat h5 i the necess of macroeconom regul and control h5 histori and realiti prove that market economi need macroeconom regul and control capitalist market economi ha exist for sever hundr year so ha macroeconom regul and control though it vari in scope and degre what need our special emphasi is that macroeconom regul and control in capitalist market economi ha not weaken instead it ha becom stronger and stronger as histori ha develop to it present stage the newli emerg industri countri sinc world war ii lay greater emphasi on and pay more attent to the role of macroeconom regul and control than the old line capitalist countri and have consequ achiev remark result the caus lie in sever point 1 the problem of overal econom balanc that is the balanc between aggreg demand and aggreg suppli 2 the problem of big econom structur such as the proport between industri and agricultur the proport between variou industri depart the relationship between industri and trade and the relationship between product develop and construct of infrastructur 3 the problem of competit on an equal basi that is oppos monopoli and maintain fair competit on an equal foot 4 the problem of the relationship between equal and effici that is maintain social justic and equal and prevent over polar while ensur a certain effici 5 the problem of public servic or social consumpt such as basic public util elementari educ public health and nation defens and secur 6 the problem of the natur and social environ in econom develop such as the ecolog balanc resourc protect environment protect and the protect of citizen live and properti the solut to all these problem depend mainli on the govern s macroeconom regul and control rather than mainli or complet on the spontan act of enterpris and individu under the influenc of the market mechan it is a gener law that market economi need macroeconom regul and control and socialist market economi is no except whi should market economi pay attent to and strengthen macroeconom regul and control under the condit of social thi is determin by it own characterist first public economi especi state own economi play a lead role in social economi it need to concentr all social forc to carri out overal major econom construct that concern the nation economi thi not onli requir the strengthen of macroeconom regul and control but also make it possibl to carri out macroeconom regul and control second it is to elimin poverti and move toward prosper togeth be the inher requir of the socialist system it set a higher demand for the relationship between effici and equal than in other countri that practic market economi consequ it will depend more on macroeconom regul and control over the state s polici for incom distribut to solv thi problem third the transit from a highli central plan economi to a socialist market economi it is a long process of explor it is not possibl to depend sole on decentr power to enterpris to achiev thi aim it should depend on macroeconom regul and control and power administr interfer by the govern fourth in the process of modern from a big agricultur countri which depend on it 800 million peasant to feed the nation it is neither possibl nor necessari for us to follow the old road of long term develop taken by countri in europ or america instead we should take a quicker road of develop with chines characterist thi requir that the govern play a greater and more forc role h3 ii the content and scope of macroeconom regul and control h3 plan financ and bank are the three import aspect of macroeconom regul and control by the state in market economi 1 plan capitalist countri also make plan howev plan made by differ countri vari in form and scope some newli emerg industri countri practic that type of economi which attach great import to plan with the govern play a guid role what we want to do in the practic of market economi is to give up the old system of plan economi thoroughli but it is by no mean the case that plan is not need we need to replac highli central mandatori plan with guidanc and polici orient plan the stress of the state plan lie in determin the strateg goal for the nation economi and social develop in a ration way do a good job in econom develop forecast control over total suppli and demand as well as program of major structur and layout of product forc focus necessari financi and materi resourc to carri out major construct and use econom lever comprehens to promot the long term stabl and coordin growth of the nation economi practic ha prove that thi kind of plan is highli necessari and workabl 2 financ it is the main mean of state macroeconom regul and control by mean of financi revenu the state can regul the aggreg social suppli and demand it can also regul the econom structur region structur and social distribut and redistribut at present the princip problem in our financ are revenu levi is not effici while it payment is far from suffici there have been great loss in tax the relationship between central financ and local financ ha not been straighten out the growth of central financi revenu lag far behind that of the nation economi be unabl to meet the need of state macroeconom regul and control in expenditur econom expenditur is not clearli separ from construct expenditur with each crowd out the other consequ the effici of util is low to solv these problem it is necessari to practic a unifi taxat system as well as the system wherebi enterpris pay tax plu a percentag of profit to strengthen supervis of tax collect by law to practic the system of tax share and to increas the proport of tax revenu go to the central govern it is also necessari to produc dual budget and handl well the relationship between feed the peopl and construct what need point out especi is that the state power of financi control and it use is the materi basi for the realiz of macroeconom regul and control power of financi control chiefli refer to the proport of nation revenu in the gnp and the proport of central revenu in the gnp sinc the reform and open up to the world these two proport have decreas quickli the proport of central revenu ha decreas by a larg margin consequ it make it difficult for state macroeconom regul and control to achiev good result due to the loss of effect financi support it also make it difficult to carri out a lot of reform measur includ price wage and other reform smoothli and in a time manner due to the lack of financi backup some peopl of insight in the west have long sinc discov that china is a countri with the most divers financi resourc and the weakest central financ control capac in the world it is becaus of a solid financi basi that those western countri that practic market economi like the unit state and japan can more effect realiz govern macroeconom regul and control thi point is worth our learn 3 bank it is the econom mean and measur for state macroeconom regul and control the govern control the overal suppli and demand for currenc the total scale of credit invest and the aggreg import and export amount by way of monetari polici and measur such as issuanc of basic currenc credit loan interest rate and exchang rate at the same time it affect the microbehavior of enterpris at present the main problem exist in our bank sector are the central bank with no independ or definit function find it difficult to establish it author the coexist of the polici orient function and busi orient function in special bank lead to inaccur action there is too much intervent in local bank by govern at variou level the dual exchang rate system confus import and export trade the way to solv them are establish an independ authorit central bank as soon as possibl organ and establish state polici orient bank chang special bank into real commerci bank limit illeg intervent in bank by local govern with law and polic chang the exchang rate system and gradual practic the system of a free exchang rate what need point out in particular is that the confus that ha occur in the present monetari system ha a lot to do with the abov mention problem moreov it also account for the fact that bank and monetari institut get involv directli or indirectli in the purchas and sale of share and secur real estat busi and non monetari profit make activ there are two type of relationship between bank and the secur sector one is the american model that is bank and secur are establish separ the other is the west european type that is bank can run secur busi at the same time as for the relationship between bank and enterpris there are three type one is the american type that is bank are strictli separ from enterpris neither can hold share in the other anoth is the german type that is bank can hold share in enterpris but not the other way round still anoth is the japanes type that is both enterpris and bank can be mutual sharehold each type ha it own merit and demerit as there are no definit respons or relationship between the central bank and special bank and between polici orient bank and commerci bank in our countri and the law concern bank institut and their oper are not perfect for a certain period of time bank and monetari institut should be forbidden to get involv in secur exchang and other activ of non monetari invest and manag otherwis it will be realli difficult to establish normal order in the monetari market the content of macroeconom regul and control in socialist market economi also includ industri polici price manag infrastructur construct state asset manag etc through the formul of industri polici the state provid enterpris with guidanc in the choic of industri for invest quicken industri adjust and replac and promot the upgrad and modern of the industri structur price manag is one of the import function of the govern price reform should be carri out in order and step by step under govern control especi when price relationship are not yet straighten out even later after price relationship are basic straighten out price of some import product concern the nation economi and the peopl s livelihood should be control directli by the state as for the construct of larg scale infrastructur major project like commun hub and citi public util which requir big invest with long construct period and low profit and even loss should mainli depend on invest from the govern state asset need govern manag all the more h3 iii problem in the present macroeconom regul and control h3 at present the main factor affect the effici of our macroeconom regul and control are 1 the basic number are not clear there exist the phenomenon of hold someth back that is no matter whether it is industri output valu invest scale financi revenu or enterpris or person incom a rather big leeway is left when report it to the higher author and there exist anoth phenomenon in undevelop area that is target output product valu revenu etc are exagger they are inflat to vari degre it is not a bad thing for local enterpris and individu to store wealth howev the problem is that the state ha no idea how big the leeway left by the local is how much falsiti there is in their report and how larg the margin is between the state statist and the actual figur it is easi to make mistak in macro decisionmak becaus of unclear base number and judgment base on unreli data 2 the mean for macroeconom regul and control are not perfect and effect the way and mean of econom manag are mani but few are realli effect scale manag is still one of the chief mean we now use to control aggreg quantiti in societi howev scale limit have been broken time and again both in invest in fix asset and in credit accord to estim by peopl in financi circl actual credit loan complet are about one fourth higher than the report figur the over scale invest and low standard in duplic construct of quit a number of local directli affect the growth of the overal effici of the nation economi it is difficult to realiz the effici of the macroeconom regul and control becaus we have not found a mean for scale manag that meet the demand of market economi 3 the power and respons of both the central and local govern are not definit neither is there ani clear divis of work between them the present situat is that the lower the administr level the greater it abil to guid and control the economi wherea the higher the administr level the weaker it abil to guid and control 4 order are not obey nor prohibit observ there is a say the experi of success gain by local author is do not do whatev the central govern ask you to do and do whatev it ask you not to do if thing go on like thi the central govern will lose it author while local govern go their own way it will be imposs to give full play to the advantag put forward by comrad deng xiaop that is social focus it strength to do big thing it also directli affect the overal effici of the nation economi to deal with the abov mention problem emphasi should be laid on do a good job in the construct of the follow four system first build a scientif nation econom statist monitor system that meet the need of the healthi develop of market economi strengthen macromonitor of basic statist work and improv the scientif reliabl and accuraci of statist monitor in order to reduc error in macro decisionmak second build a sound macroeconom regul and control system that meet the need of the develop of socialist market economi the variou econom lever should be adjust in accord with the complex and particular of the target of regul dure the transit of the econom system so as to ensur time appropri and effect adjust especi at present we should intensifi the applic of financi mean as the present financi system is far behind thi need the step of reform the financi system should be quicken third establish and perfect as soon as possibl a respons power divis system divid the financi power and administr power reason between the central and local govern and set a definit divis of work and respons so that each exercis it function to do a good job in whatev it should take care of fourth speed up the establish of a system to guarante effect implement of the macropolici strengthen the construct of a legisl and law enforc conting strengthen supervis and administ accord to law so as to maintain the inviol of state polici and regul and thoroughli chang the situat in which law are neither observ nor serious enforc
