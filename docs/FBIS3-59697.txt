agenc of natur resourc and energi instal on rokko island kobe an on site fuel cell unit consist of fourteen 50 kw unit and one 200 kw unit with total output of 900 kw combin with solar photovolta and wind power gener system research is direct at the solut of technic problem dure the linkag of dispers type power sourc with the power grid as for larg capac unit tokyo electr power co inc tepco construct the world s largest 11 000 kw class plant on the premis of goi thermal power station base on the technic data of the oper research conduct with a 4 500 kw pilot plant until 1985 the new plant start oper in 1991 pafc technolog research associ establish jointli by ga and electr power compani is conduct research on the improv of pafc with subsidi provid by the agenc of natur resourc and energi the purpos is to introduc pafc power plant in practic use at an earli date the research associ is develop a 5 000 kw pressur plant and 1 000 kw ambient pressur plant with power gener effici of over 42 percnt and featur low cost high reliabl and compact in a six year program from 1991 to 1996 the abov mention 5 000 kw plant ha been design base on the oper data obtain from two 1 000 kw plant develop by kansai electr power and chubu electr power as a nation project sinc 1987 new project ha start after the evalu of the previou data and map out the plan for the next step by the central electr power council h5 2 molten carbon fuel cell mcfc h5 molten carbon fuel cell are expect to be promis altern power sourc to thermal power plant sinc coal ga can be employ with high effici the develop of mcfc ha been led by mcfc technolog research associ in the framework of the new sunshin former moonlight project and center on elementari research such as the develop of peripher equip of cell stack and reform ten electr power compani becam member of the associ in may 1993 to take part in the develop project of a 1 000 kw class pilot plant extern reform type to be start in the second half of thi year base on the government interim evalu in addit electr power compani are conduct basic research and survey separ kansai electr power and mitsubishi electr corp have been conduct for exampl joint oper research of a 100 kw class stack of indirect intern reform type sinc may 1992 h5 3 solid oxid fuel cell h5 the develop of solid oxid fuel cell in japan is at a stage of elementari research for stack with an output of 200 1 000kw they are rank as promis fuel cell of the next gener follow pafc and mcfc the electr power industri is accumul technic data through basic research and oper test and is also conduct survey on research trend and theme in japan and abroad tepco ha been conduct joint r amp d with mitsubishi heavi industri ltd sinc 1986 and carri out gener test of a 1 kw stack to which electr power develop co later join chubu electr power and mitsubishi heavi industri have jointli develop a 1 kw stack of monoblock layer built type furthermor kansai electr power in a joint project with tokyo ga osaka ga and westinghous of the u s ha develop a 25 kw cell system the largest solid oxid fuel cell unit so far in the world oper research ha been conduct for thi plant instal in the new energi test center of kansai electr on rokko island sinc april 1992 h5 3 task for practic use of fuel cell h5 as mention abov the govern and the electr power industri are conduct research and collect data in variou form for the develop of fuel cell numer task are still necessari befor fuel cell can be practic appli and introduc as gener system of electr util enterpris h5 1 higher perform and longer servic life h5 the perform of modern fuel cell ha alreadi attain a current densiti of 200 250ma cm lt sup gt 2 lt sup gt and an output densiti of 0 13 0 16w cm lt sup gt 2 lt sup gt under ambient pressur and 200 300 ma cm lt sup gt 2 lt sup gt and 0 15 0 22a cm lt sup gt 2 lt sup gt respect in pressur state the emphasi is expect to shift hereaft to longer servic life and higher stabil rather than higher output densiti the longest cumul oper time so far is 18 377 hour as of march 1993 achiev by a 200 kw plant made by ifc of america and instal in tepco shibaura squar build tokyo the longest continu oper time of over 4 000 hour ha also been establish the reliabl of a plant need constant improv over numer test a servic life of over 40 000 hour is regard as essenti present research is target at thi valu improv of catalyst perform and technolog to prevent the loss of electrolyt are await to lead to target perform h5 2 cost reduct h5 cost is the greatest problem that should be surmount befor practic applic cost below yen 200 000 yen 250 000 per kw is requir thi correspond to about 1 4 to 1 5 of the present level of cost cost reduct may be achiev through higher perform of the cell themselv simplif and compact of the plant includ peripher equip higher skill and standard of manufactur process and the mass product effect brought about through expand market h5 3 compact h5 the instal space of the equip is an import factor for practic applic in japan with it high land price present plant tend to disregard compact sinc they are mainli intend for research and test the 5 000 kw stack of pafc associ occupi an instal space of about 0 27m lt sup gt 2 lt sup gt kw thi must be reduc to 1 3 if the system is to be competit with exist ga turbin and ga engin h5 4 conclus h5 an interim report by the demand and suppli subcommitte of the central electr power council in june 1990 estim that the capac of dispers type power sourc in the electr util industri will reach 1 1 million kw of which fuel cell will account for 1 05 million kw by the end of the year 2000 and 5 7 million kw 5 5 million kw ditto by 2010 mount interest in the global environ ha also attract gener attent to the develop and applic of fuel cell with it potenti for environment protect and effect util of energi under these circumst japan s electr power industri intend to make the utmost effort for experiment introduct and technolog develop of phosphor acid fuel cell for the time be the r amp d of advanc type cell such as molten carbon type and solid oxid type will be step up at the same time as regard so call new energi gener includ fuel cell photovolta gener and wind power gener the electr power industri is readi to cooper with user who own these facil and to purchas the surplu power from these user if desir under certain condit through link with the power grid so as to posit promot the introduct of environ friendli new energi gener
