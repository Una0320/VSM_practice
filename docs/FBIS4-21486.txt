cso f p 106 articl by dieter mueller first german f facil for chemic recycl of polyurethan subhead up to 1000 ton per year of polyurethan wast materi from product of shoe sole to undergo recycl by be broken down into sourc materi text pirmasen 11 march 1994 up until now industri ha been abl at most to process polyurethan pur system into press slab via veri unsatisfactori particl recycl such is no longer the case regra recycl gmbh in pirmasen gersbach recent introduc the first facil throughout the frg for chemic recycl of the product wast materi from pur shoe sole in the view of prof dr gunter bauer of aalen colleg it can right claim to be a strictli defin recycl principl in the word of heinz bader regra s manag director the nearli dm1 7 million invest in the new pur recycl system should be amort in fewer than five year he see the reason for thi in the rise cost for dispos and the somewhat more favor price for the recycl materi recypol compar to new materi but what make the system quickli profit is primarili the fact that up to 20 percent of the pur shoe sole output can be reincorpor into the new materi nor do exist facil have to be overhaul onli a meter product feed system ha to be integr for deliveri of the recycl materi as bader explain when introduc the pur recycl system in pirmasen in the middl of decemb the batch process facil ha a capac of 1000 ton per year superfici consid therefor it would be over size for process the approxim 70 t per year that result from the chlorofluorocarbon cfc free shoe sole output of regra kunststofftechnik gmbh but the compani is offer the excess capac to other firm that use similar pur system for recycl on a paid basi addit bader figur that the invest risk is limit the nearli 70 ton of pur wast materi from hi own group to be process have a materi valu of nearli dm400 000 as the regra manag director put it valuabl replac materi that are too good to dispos of not to mention the high fee for do so by comparison the system wa built by kloeckner ferromatik desma achim to the specif of the recycl firm and cost approxim dm500 000 exclud r amp d outlay prof dr gunter bauer of aalen colleg hold the patent for the process he wa entrust with it develop under a regra research commiss the recycl compani howev ha secur for itself exclus market licens elastogram gmbh lemfoerd a member of the basf group contribut appli engin support as a raw materi supplier of pur system develop and creation of the system were sponsor by the rhineland palatin environment and econom ministri bader applaud the support as noth to be taken for grant accord to prof bauer the goal in develop the process wa not to includ ani new materi polyol and isocyan compon in the process that mean radic modifi the process so that the onli materi use for it are those alreadi use in the manufactur of shoe sole in thi context polyol is combin in a reactor with the wast materi and convert into a dispers at a maximum of 200 degre c use a catalyst the aalen professor optimist explain that is whi thi recycl process can right claim to be a strictli defin recycl principl one qualif ha to be made howev the process ha to be respect adjust for the specif pur recip recycl expert therefor cannot convert one recip one day and anoth the next day into a singli recycl polyol or even deliv blend pur wast materi to the process still manag director baden is optimist about find custom for the system and or recycl order on a paid basi in the shoe sole recycl sector initi becaus of the similar recip as prof bauer state other pur processor are confront the same problem as we are for exampl five million ton of pur system are use around the world 1991 up to eight percent of that result from product wast materi in thi context advanc in pur recycl technolog are make a notic contribut to the save of resourc progress ha also been report in the field of process blend pur wast materi use glycolysi bernard naber a degre chemist and recycl expert with basf schwarzheid gmbh report thi in the cours of regra s introduct of a project of the develop corpor for the recycl of plastic ewvk in wiesbaden in which recycl wa tri out on 1 6 ton of pur low densiti foam materi from use car seat as conclud by pur expert each automobil account for nearli 10 kg of foam materi of variou sort block cold form heat form foam materi in the word of naber the non uniform chemic composit made it imposs to sort out the wast materi still accord to the schwarzheid pur recycl expert despit such unfavor precondit glycolysi is except well suit to be a recycl process the reason is that in the quest for new field of applic it turn out that the pur recycl product can be use especi for the product of solid foam materi as well as coat system pur specialist reintroduc up to 81 percent of the recycl product into the polyol compon for a solid foam and up to 90 percent for a coat system naber is convinc the recycl product display a properti profil that is compar to that of convent manufactur pur product as earli as the spring of 1994 therefor an initi facil oper accord to such specif is suppos to start process the product residu of a larg frg automobil supplier
