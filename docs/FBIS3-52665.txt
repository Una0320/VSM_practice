champion islam the govern burden by it econom social and human right record would have littl els to offer that is not though the view of gener al bashir our guid principl are constant and have noth to do with the conflict in southern sudan or the econom situat he said in an interview on the contrari we believ that these guid principl address mani of the grievanc that have led to the conflict when you tri appli islam idea it could be that there are point of converg between islam thinker and differ as well you find differ point of view to the extrem right and the extrem left our way is mediat in sudan s last multi parti elect in april 1986 the nation islam front nif led by hasan al turabi won less than a quarter of the vote mr al turabi ha steer the polici of the govern from behind the scene sinc it took power in 1989 even within the conserv muslim brotherhood which ha been split sinc 1991 in sudan there are doubt about the govern s cours the major of peopl in the sudan are muslim so we don t need to impos islam law on peopl thi can be achiev through negoti and dialogu hibr yusuf nur al dayim the leader of the brotherhood in khartoum said the brotherhood believ muslim leader should particip in govern but to tri to be the sole figur in sudan is unwis becaus there are so mani differ parti in sudan neither are religi figur necessarili at one with the govern s suppos religi foundat

suppress it sudan as it grow is an islam model and richer muslim countri are grow a littl bit jealou of it dr al turabi said our most seriou problem in sudan sinc independ ha been the search for stabl govern at one point we had a formal democraci rule by tribal famili then a militari dictatorship becaus there is now a religi spirit the militari can t rule the govern he said the regim s islam veneer receiv the same condemn from opposit politician as from religi leader sid ahmad al husayn the local leader of one of the main opposit parti the democrat unionist parti ha been in ghost hous detent in a convert khartoum branch of citibank for the past five week but sadiq al mahdi leader of the other main opposit parti al ummah who wa prime minist dure the 1986 89 multi parti era is abl to speak from the eleg villa in omdurman where he ha live sinc hi overthrow by gen al bashir in june 1989 the main polit parti were commit to islamis but the islam programm had to be non partisan and befor it wa implement there had to be a bill of right clearli defin the right of non muslim said mr al mahdi who live under constant armi and polic surveil hi sister is marri to the nif leader dr al turabi the nif with it militari alli ha realli put asid all those principl accord to the koran there s no way of establish islam author by a coup d etat becaus anyth that is base on compuls is null and void onli the implement of the instrument of power in a veri callou way ha sustain the govern in power just like mani other dictat and becaus they have so isol themselv from other polit forc within the countri fear of repris from within is what keep them togeth mr al mahdi s accus continu the countri s welfar state ha been withdrawn and the save have gone to secur the free market polici ha so lost the confid of the busi commun that 70 billion 47 billion pound of person wealth is now outsid the countri for the flrst time in sudan s histori there is substanti southern support call for self determin which mark a big polit failur for the govern against thi muhammad al amin khalifah a former armi colonel who is now the influenti speaker of the govern appoint transit nation assembl tna argu anybodi

polit stabil in a multi parti system mr khalifah said but if ani averag sudanes believ polit salvat might lie in an islam option materi condit must be erad that hope ordinari peopl no longer believ the nif govern is go to solv their problem a former minist said they don t believ thi is what islam mean they know the nif is a veri effici machin of oppress the govern s determin to conceal from it own peopl who is realli in charg confirm thi sceptic view particularli it effort to avoid ani suggest that dr al turabi ha more than an indirect influenc presid al bashir said in sudan there is freedom of creativ and everyth is open to debat there is not an islam establish and al turabi doesn t repres an islam establish nor are hi religi view bind on peopl the presid also deni the accus of
