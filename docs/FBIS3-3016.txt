nuclear power station are potenti danger with respect to their nuclear materi and wast which have to be properli treat and accid that might occur is there a contradict between environment protect and the develop of nuclear power as a state organ in charg of environment protect what is your comment on the polici of develop nuclear power qu your first question is about how the pollut caus loss are

expert in thi area but he ask me to comment on it briefli china ha onli two nuclear power station the dayawan and qinshan nuclear power station we also plan to build more nuclear power station in guangdong and energi defici area along the coast compar with tradit power plant that gener electr by burn coal or oil nuclear power station should be consid a sourc of clear energi the key requir is that these station must have safeti measur so when the nuclear power station were built china attach top prioriti to their qualiti and safeti the two nuclear power station are veri safe they have the highest safeti coeffici in the world as as long as we strengthen manag nuclear power station will not endang the environ the two nuclear power station are now oper veri well as for the problem of treat nuclear wast thi is a global problem but thi is not a big problem for china whi we have onli two nuclear power station in addit china ha veri larg veri effici and veri safe vault ku for the storag of nuclear wast so the treatment of nuclear wast is not a problem as far as china is concern lin zongtang we have veri good storag facil in the gobi desert laugh heartili qu so countrymen in
