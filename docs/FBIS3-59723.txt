howev there are also exampl in prior research on hydrogen engin of suppress of abnorm combust without a reduct in hydrogen suppli through the introduct of sodium contain exhaust valv and a system for water inject within cylind to cool sourc of ignit evalu of hydrogen reciproc engin ce below predat hydrogen re ha shown a declin in output to roughli 50 percnt that of gasolin engin use for comparison in hydrogen ce we evalu the caus thereof were shown to be restrict to a lean region with an excess air ratio lgr of 1 8 or more in order to prevent abnorm combust and a reduct of intak air due to the larg volum occupi by the hydrogen ga fuel both of which result in a reduct of heat suppli to 54 percnt that of a gasolin engin consequ we consid these 2 factor the main caus of the low hydrogen ce output in contrast the work chamber in an re revolv as shown in figur 6 and the locat where intak compress expans and exhaust stroke occur differ we believ that the rel low temperatur of the work

contrast an intak stroke inject system re wa success oper at up to 6 500 rpm near lgr 1 we feel thi is due to the product of non uniform fuel region with the intak stroke inject system and a result weaker air fuel ratio in mixtur air near ignit sourc than with premix the follow studi were made on the intak stroke inject system superior in output 2 effect of spark plug heat valu we investig the

work chamber begin immedi after spark plug exposur dure compress from the cours of thi occurr we surmis that spark plug becom ignit caus prematur ignit which further rais spark plug temperatur increas the frequenc and quicken the occurr of prematur ignit to verifi thi theori we investig the relationship between prematur ignit and heat valu by substitut spark plug with effect high heat valu for the low temperatur spark plug as shown in figur 10 the excess air ratio lgr at which prematur ignit began declin after an increas in spark plug heat valu from the gasolin specif heat valu of 5 as a result we learn that normal oper is possibl even at lgr 1 when heat valu are rais to 13 consequ it becam clear that spark plug were the ignit sourc for the prematur ignit in figur 9 and that abnorm combust can be avoid even at lgr 1 through the use of spark plug with a high heat valu in supplementari experi we found that the heat valu of l plug affect the occurr of prematur ignit fig id jpr jst 003lc

theoret air fuel ratio capabl of draw maximum output mere switch to spark plug with a heat valu suit to engin requir is suffici it is thu demonstr that re possess a structur which is fundament easili adapt to hydrogen engin for which prevent abnorm combust is the most import concern nonetheless the 75 percnt of gasolin specif output obtain even through oper at the theoret air fuel ratio is low likewis sinc air and hydrogen are simultan inject by the intak stroke inject system we studi air quantiti dure intak is reduc approxim 30 percnt by hydrogen volum and volumetr effici is low

in contrast to the mere 1 7 percnt occupi by gasolin vapor and even when the ga mixtur natur input to a premix system in which hydrogen is mix in the intak pipe is consid quantit the same as that in a

for the intak stroke as shown in figur 18 hydrogen is inject into the work chamber for the compress stroke for an interv of approxim 90 degre main shaft angl start immedi after the end of air intak through the air port in the left draw of figur 17 air is be drawn into the work chamber dure the intak stroke and the hydrogen valv is still close the right draw depict a point dure the compress

is roughli equival the slightli lower air quantiti in the direct inject system is ascrib to the effect of residu hydrogen in the channel from the hydrogen valv to the hydrogen port which is carri in

that supercharg statu is not achiev at 1 000 rpm is laid princip to the fact that air port time in thi engin is design for high revolut and not enough air is taken in at low revolut rang to achiev supercharg thu supercharg may be made possibl at all revolut rang if a variabl time air port is subsequ develop and incorpor time match to low revolut rang the abov discuss studi show that volumetr
