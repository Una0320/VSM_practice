the healthi matur of democrat polit and the implement of local autonomi the roc s progress in recent year in pursu democrat polit on taiwan is yet anoth achiev after our countri s econom develop and thu merit our attent the quintess of democrat polit is to consid peopl s interest and allow peopl to decid thing in all matter instead of steer public opinion the govern s function are to coordin variou interest through the applic of profession knowledg and embodi them in polici and practic that satisfi the requir both of ideal and of practic and find accept among the major of peopl civil servant should go down to the grass root and approach matter from a popular perspect polici are feasibl onli if they are support by most peopl next we should maintain our stand on administ govern
