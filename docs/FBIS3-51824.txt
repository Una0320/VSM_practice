new presid magistr amado gutierrez velasquez sent you a letter on wednesday 19 januari in which it request inform regard the constitut and legal reason behind the presenc of u s troop in differ part of our countri is the presid will to give out that inform gaviria more than that i have given instruct for the defens ministri to give out all the inform it ha on the temporari presenc of u s troop in the countri the govern is will as it ha alway been to fulli cooper with the council of state not onli by turn over document but also by make the necessari explan to clear up thi matter el tiempo as for the presenc of u s troop in juanchaco whi did the govern not ask the senat or the council of state for author as the nation constitut requir gaviria it is clear that the govern believ the presenc of u s troop or those of other countri that enter colombian territori to provid technic and train assist and that observ intern agreement doe not violat the constitut the legal base for thi type of exercis is the inter american reciproc assist treati tiar which is current in effect it wa sign by colombia and approv by the congress of the republ in 1947 thi treati wa follow by the mutual defens assist agreement sign on 17 april 1952 these type of militari mission are carri out in colombia base on legal document that have been in effect sinc the middl of the centuri as for the joint militari engin exercis take place in juanchaco in which neither militari personnel as publish nor warship are particip there is a memorandum of understand and an agreement sign by defens minist rafael pardo and u s ambassador morri busbi on 29 octob 1993 these instrument lie within the framework of among other the tiar they specifi that the mission will be joint militari engin exercis for train purpos which will lead to the construct of variou project for commun use other similar agreement exist one of them ha to do with the exchang of militari personnel anoth ha to do with the integr of the radar network locat in the caribbean and anoth is aim at expand the naval river fleet moreov within the same framework of the tiar there have been variou joint exercis with militari unit from variou latin american countri we can mention the well known naval oper call unita 34 of which have alreadi been held they have been held everi year sinc 1959 in colombian territori water as well as in other countri naval unit from variou countri are train with regard to the joint procedur that would be follow in case of an attack from outsid the contin a land exercis ha taken place each year sinc 1962 at a place known as la cangrejera on the atlant coast in 1983 two exercis took place one in tumaco and anoth in san andr in 1991 and 1992 exercis took place in the vicin of the bahia malaga naval base they were joint exercis with the particip of u s and colombian soldier among other therefor by virtu of the fact that at the time tiar wa approv by the congress the defens ministri and all exercis have been carri out on these same legal assumpt and never ha anyon object i do not consid it necessari to request author from the senat or request the opinion of the council of state or inform ani other author the same way it wa not done in the past with unita and other similar exercis el tiempo but do you believ mr presid that the countri is so naiv as to believ that 150 men from the unit state are need to build a small school gaviria of cours not all these project can be done by the colombian state but here lie the mistak these gentlemen are militari engin and have come here to carri out joint exercis with colombian militari forc the idea is to teach and practic to share technic experi to solv logist and commun problem which eventu our men would meet in a situat of war instead of expend energi build or make useless thing they dedic their energi to civic and solidar object the idea is to take advantag of the joint militari engin train and at the same time benefit the area and the commun el tiempo doe the presenc of u s soldier in juanchaco violat colombian sovereignti gaviria the presid doe not see it that way the u s militari engin are in an area total under the control of the colombian navi and carri out their work under the supervis of the arm forc i must also insist that the presenc of militari mission do civilian work is cover by intern agreement that are current in forc the problem is that mani stori have been weav around thi in fact the el tiempo sunday edit highlight the lie that have been use to attack the peopl s good faith i have even heard that a u s base will be built in juanchaco to replac the one in panama or wors yet that a new transocean canal is be design good graciou one need to be veri naiv or veri ill intent to spread stori such as these that make no sens all thi uproar lead me to wonder that onc studi are complet which both the council of state and the prosecutor gener s offic are do the countri must reflect and decid whether or not it want thi type of assist in the futur my person opinion is that if one believ that thi type of assist is an affront to our sovereignti one is close the door on someth that is basic to make our arm forc more profession not onli that but we would end cooper equip suppli mainten and intellig that allow us to fight crime el tiempo presid but juanchaco is not the onli case what were the u s plane that overflew barranquilla thi weekend up to gaviria accord to what the militari forc gener command and the fac colombian air forc report to me the weekend barranquilla overflight had been legal author earlier the civil aeronaut board through the director of air oper had inform on the atlant coast area that thi type of aircraft wa go to overfli colombia in it fight against drug traffick receiv support from the unit state and other countri we do not have all the equip or the requir technolog to support with technic intellig the struggl against drug traffick on the basi of current agreement that seek to repress illeg drug traffick the defens ministri request when condit warrant the support of u s plane that are special equip to detect airplan that have not file a flight plan it is worth mention that overflight by u s airplan are author by decre no 1692 of 1992 the overflight are to inform the colombian author on the presenc of unauthor plane and that ani other measur such as chase these airplan is exclus the respons of the fac and other nation author you might be ask yourselv whi the air traffic control did not know becaus there are ongo investig of air control involv in drug traffick there are also peopl who are interest in stir up fals sovereignti debat encourag by dark sponsor if we are concern about defend our air space sovereignti the true threat doe not lie in joint oper with the help of friendli countri danger to sovereignti to colombian societi and air secur aris with the hundr of illeg flight without flight plan and with pervers motiv carri out by gun runner and drug traffick over our territori the author overflight are precis an act of sovereignti to prevent our air space from be use with impun by colombia s true enemi el tiempo how mani air surveil radar ha the unit state instal in colombia who oper them and who use the inform they collect gaviria current the unit state ha instal four radar the locat facil and equip are under the command oper and respons of colombian militari author some oper with the technic assist of u s civilian organ and other with the technic assist of u s militari personnel the radar purpos is precis what i talk to you about earlier that is to use technic mean to enforc control surveil and sovereignti the inform gather is at the dispos of the colombian arm forc which use it to plan oper colombia ha alway press the intern commun to obtain more equip which serv to enhanc our intellig work i wish we had more radar and more technic assist in these matter el tiempo some day ago you said the u s militari oper in juanchaco wa humanitarian in natur do you still feel that way gaviria to be precis i would be more accur to talk of it as a solidar or civic oper i feel that build a hospit or a school like the u s militari engin are do as a by product of the joint exercis is a task that entail goodwil and as the juanchaco resid have said it benefit the peopl of the zone where it occur el tiempo is there ani relat between the war against the cali cartel and the juanchaco oper do the militari oper in juanchaco includ build and oper radio beacon that seek to control drug traffick gaviria i believ i have state with suffici clariti that the juanchaco activ which stem from the memoranda of agreement and understand sign between defens minist rafael pardo and u s ambassador busbi have no other purpos than the one announc the joint implement of militari engin project base on reciproc assist treati moreov in view of the evid need of the peopl of that area of the countri the defens ministri and the vall depart governor s offic sign a contract last decemb to build a land strip in juanchaco the codazzi militari engin battalion is implement that project although thi project is be carri out simultan with the one mention earlier it ha no connect with the project the u s soldier are implement all of thi fall within the framework of the colombian constitut and law some peopl who are doubt have legitim concern other who vehement defend the notion of a u s invas are espous a fals nation that come from bad inform or shadi interest el tiempo whi have there been so mani contradict so much secreci so much mysteri in the handl of thi case gaviria no there ha not been ani of that from the start i report the activ go on in juanchaco if you compar the inform the govern issu in decemb to current inform it is exactli the same the public is awar of the scope of the oper arm forc offic have been readi to speak with report and some report have even visit the site as i said i think it is legitim that doubt and question are express at polit and public opinion level and the govern ha the oblig to answer them i also think howev the countri is the victim of an exacerb and ill intend distort of event i am not rule out the exist of a misinform campaign aim at creat sentiment against intern cooper in the struggl against drug traffick in the past drug traffick have manipul a fals sens of nation to undermin the nation s purpos of rid itself from the slaveri that crimin organ have tri to impos on it we cannot be stoog for those who hide behind our flag to evad the law and protect their illicit busi el tiempo last week s issu of semana refer to a convers with prosecutor gustavo de greiff and u s attorney gener janet reno in which the possibl of pardon the member of the cali cartel wa mention how do you feel about it gaviria regard your question the countri know we are studi the topic either through consult between presid or contact the foreign minist ha made we will make a decis at an opportun time a decis will respond to the interest of colombia and america concern the privat convers between the prosecutor gener and ms reno i must inform you that the inform i have is quit differ from that publish in the weekli in question never for exampl wa there ani mention of the word pardon a pardon is a moral and legal imposs of which neither the presid nor the prosecutor could approv under ani circumst for obviou reason the presid of the republ cannot expand on the issu discuss in that privat meet but he is convinc that the term of the convers differ from the report that were publish what must be stress is that after that convers prosecutor gener de greiff and the u s justic depart manag to settl most of the differ that had emerg dure the process of legal cooper wherebi the proof gather in the unit state against drug traffick wa collect for the colombian court nevertheless becaus i am alreadi discuss thi topic allow me to tell you that the presid of the republ ha a high opinion of the prosecutor gener who ha becom one of the moral pillar of our societi with hi legal wisdom and administr skill he ha built the prosecutor gener s offic which wa creat by the 1991 constitut to establish system of litig in our countri moreov he ha done much more than thi he ha brave confront the threat of crimin who see in the prosecutor gener a respres of colombian who refus to allow themselv to be defeat and were not frighten by the onslaught of violenc the prosecutor work shoulder to shoulder with the presid of the republ and hi staff to develop and consolid polici such as the polici of submiss to justic which ha allow a tangibl reduct of the terrorist phenomena associ with drug trafick more recent the prosecutor ha made progress in bring to trial sentenc and jail sever crimin of cours there have been time when we held differ point of view in short differ opinion concern the way to handl particular case becaus of the good relationship that exist between the presid and the prosecutor and becaus of the need which is acknowledg by everyon to work as a team these differ have been elimin for the good of the countri el tiempo are the differ the public perceiv between the presid and the attorney gener s offic concern the surrend process for the cali cartel real or imagin gaviria they are normal within the sphere of respons of each of the institut the attorney gener s offic on one hand strictli fulfil the dictat of the penal code as it pertain to the right of defend the govern on the other hand also insist on implement strict penalti and on grant the necessari guarante of secur to those peopl who surrend to justic i believ i share the prosecutor s view concern the drug lord eventu surrend to justic moreov if one member of the drug traffick hierarchi want to adher to thi polici he must be sent to a top secur jail also if he want to obtain from the govern the implicit benefit of the submiss polici he must cooper with the author and confess el tiempo the way these drug traffick are be held in custodi seem to be one of the reason for disagr to what extent is the govern s sever due to what could be describ as la catedr syndrom refer to envigado maximum secur prison in medellin also known as la catedr consid to be one of the most secur prison in latin america gaviria the govern ha learn from past experi good and bad in turn the govern must make sure that member of societi who surrend to the author do not mock the administr of justic the onli way to control eventu abus is to keep the inmat in high secur prison protect their right and give them all proper guarante but also have them do their duti as inmat el tiempo the u s govern reportedli ha made statement and appli pressur regard the cali cartel it ha also been said that a certain indulg of your toward washington is link to your campaign for the post of oa secretari gener what have you to say about thi gaviria the unit state is not the onli one that want us to work with the same zeal with which we defeat the now virtual extinct medellin cartel colombian societi is also commit to thi effort with or without the intern commun s request colombia must continu to firmli combat drug traffick colombia must wage a life or death struggl against drug traffick with tool such as surrend i am firmli determin to maintain thi polici i have stood firmli against drug traffick throughout my public life when i wa a congressman dure my campaign for presid when i took up lui carlo galan s banner and as presid of the republ the suggest that the presid of the republ s view of thi problem is influenc by cesar gaviria s eventu run as candid for the post of oa secretari gener is evil and ill intent the countri is familiar with my posit regard drug traffick el tiempo behind the probabl surrend of the topmost leader of the cali cartel and other drug traffick organ lie the offer of those who control a larg part of the drug suppli to the unit state to dismantl the busi apart from put a few drug traffick behind bar is it not import for the govern to dismantl a busi whose profit can run in the million and the countri s most complex crimin organ gaviria it is the duti of thi govern the prosecutor gener s offic and the attorney gener s offic to find a good judici solut to break impun and to have the leader of crimin organ cooper with justic go to prison and serv sentenc that serv as deterr if in addit their illeg activ are dismantl i am sure the attorney gener s offic can negoti sentenc in accord with the penal procedur code in due time the prosecutor gener s offic itself will be abl to assess the cooper of those who submit themselv to justic thi polici must be accompani by the combin action of the intellig servic the public forc the prosecutor gener s offic and the attorney gener s offic against crimin organ action that will make it possibl to dismantl their illeg activ and build up legal sound case i want to go further howev it must be crystal clear to the countri that it is imposs to coexist with the mafia either those that perpetr terrorist action or those that hide beneath a peac appear everi colombian must be watch to prevent a climat of rel complac toward drug traffick from lead us to pain situat like the one we experienc in the past i am sure thi view is share by the prosecutor gener and the attorney gener our share object is to rid colombia of the crimin drug traffick organ el tiempo in thursday s counterescap column and in relat to the attempt on the financ minist s life and renew guerrilla activ journalist enriqu santo calderon question the militari intellig servic effici and the arm forc capabl to counter these attack what do you have to say about thi gaviria the arm forc have substanti improv their abil to deal with organ crime in fact we can

as a result of the public forc s perman activ and the result obtain in the struggl against subvers subvers organ have been perpetr terrorist action to cast a fals imag of their arm power in addit in view of their complet polit isol in thi pre elector time they can do noth other than perpetr terrorist action to make themselv known as an activ organ nevertheless and despit the seriou event of thi week the guerrilla are clearli lose their emphasi on polit and their action are becom more and more like those of a mafia or organ crime the attempt on the financ minist s life and the use of terror indic the guerrilla militari weak we coincid with columnist santo calderon in that to deal with these peopl in thi new way it is mandatori to keep reinforc the intellig servic work and of cours to
