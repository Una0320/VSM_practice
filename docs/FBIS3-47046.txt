languag f p 105 japanes f articl type bfn text the scienc and technolog agenc and the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corpor have decid on a plan to build the world s first monobloc reactor that will have fuel reprocess facil and fuel assembl facil incorpor into a singl unit thi prototyp reactor reactor no 2 will be a successor to the plutonium fuel monju prototyp fast breeder reactor which is due to becom fulli oper in april in a monobloc reactor nuclear materi can be handl intern and need not be brought out of the facil henc there is no need to worri about the possibl of plutonium be rob by terrorist group it will be an advanc atom reactor which burn fuel with highli toxic transuran element mix in it thu reduc the danger of produc nuclear dust the plan will be includ in the govern s long term plan on nuclear power develop and util which will be final thi summer and it envisag put the reactor into oper around 2015 the system is expect to contribut to sooth foreign countri concern about japan s use of plutonium normal plutonium is gener when uranium is burnt in a nuclear reactor and highli enrich plutonium can be use on the warhead of nuclear missil plutonium reprocess and fuel process as such are consid veri delic technolog and even peac purpos facil are subject to strict inspect by the intern atom energi agenc and de facto surveil by the unit state japan which believ the fast breeder reactor fbr should be the countri s main nuclear reactor in the forthcom centuri need to make it plan transpar so it will not be suspect of have nuclear weapon design as the dprk north korea current is japan must also develop an fbr system which cannot be convert for use in make nuclear arm a monobloc reactor will not requir plutonium shipment except for one initi load therefor the system is expect to easili gain the understand of the clinton govern which want to enforc the nuclear non prolifer treati in addit the system ha the great merit of be abl to burn the transuran element which can eman strong radioact for hundr to ten of thousand of year in the reactor when the atom nuclei of these element are bombard by neutron the element chang into substanc of shorter radioact or lower radioact which mean they can be easili store underground abov all the system preclud the possibl of pure plutonium which is gener in the reprocess process at present be use in make arm in order to incorpor thi new technolog into a prototyp reactor the power reactor and nuclear fuel develop corpor intend to chang in the futur the core of the monju reactor which will becom oper in april go into the 21st centuri the corpor will also launch relat research and develop project includ one to studi the burn of transuran element on the first prototyp reactor to be built in the earli 21st centuri the electr power industri ha alreadi decid that it should be of a top entri word publish in english type wherein coolant are pour in from the top of the reactor
