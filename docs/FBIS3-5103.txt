it is also true that there ha been critic say that not enough ha been accomplish in administr reform while we are submit legisl to thi session of the diet to establish a committe on administr reform i have resolv that the question befor us is that of how to achiev effect administr reform and am determin to promot visibl administr reform while i believ that our decis to implement the largest ever incom tax and resid tax cut wa both necessari and justifi given the current econom situat that doe not give us licens to be irrespons about the veri seriou fiscal situat that will exist at the end of fiscal 1994 includ nation bond outstand in excess of 200 trillion yen and a substanti overhang of local govern bond it is imper that the peopl understand that we cannot let the fiscal situat deterior
