hyperinfl hyperinfl ha had a destruct and devast effect on all sphere of life it ha block product contribut to mani an injustic in distribut and brought the standard of live of the major of popul below the level of bare subsist the program for reconstruct of the monetari system and the strategi of econom recoveri that we have start to implement ha prove to be the onli respons to the great

and financi disciplin these be essenti element of monetari reform and the most import mean of curb inflat are onli the initi albeit inevit step in the attempt to stabil the economi and bring an increas in product employ and the standard of live an examin ha shown that our foreign exchang and other reserv are greater than had been assum and in ani case suffici if the whole program is consist implement the program must be regard not onli as a packag of measur to curb hyperinfl and bring a short term improv of the econom situat but also as a fundament turnabout in the way we conduct econom oper there ha long been such an intent in the project of our econom system but it ha never been consist appli what wa lack wa a healthi currenc as the object criterion for busi or ani other kind of decisionmak in econom life and that we now have the reform of the monetari system put strong pressur on the economi in the direct of ration behavior which is not onli in one s own interest but also in the gener social interest with increas independ the respons of an enterpris for it surviv and prosper as well as for the exist of the worker it employ increas by do away with primari emiss wage must be earn and in order to earn them one must produc and in fact produc the good the market want one of the basic aim of econom polici will be to support the restructur of big enterpris where econom justifi and to stimul the more rapid develop of small and medium size enterpris of cours the state cannot take upon itself the the enterpris job of increas product and improv effici howev it can give it support to stimul entrepreneurship and market orient product and will do so proceed from the fact that a healthi dinar is abov all the main motiv and at the same time an econom imper for achiev better result we shall tri to expand the domest market for the reconstruct and the new product the govern shall be particularli activ in encourag the export orient of our economi although we are awar of all the limit that have been impos by the sanction howev export possibl exist even now we particularli need to prepar for the period after the sanction are lift the serbian economi ha alway had it place in the world it had and still ha someth to offer to the world market we shall also creat favor condit for foreign capit invest serbia cannot achiev it econom independ within a close economi but onli through a decis and wise open up toward the world base on our development advantag primarili our expert and qualifi peopl particularli the young one signific industri capac agricultur natur resourc and the favor econom posit of our countri with the success monetari reconstruct of our monetari system we have in thi phase stabil the economi and help the existenti most threaten level of societi thi must now be accompani by an increas in product and real wage and must coincid with the initi of new invest our polici is aim at increas the nation revenu and measur to make it distribut econom stimul and in social term as fair as possibl i appeal to you to help us realiz these task in spite of the parti differ which we will respect the difficult task of rebalanc the republ s budget lie befor us the increas of ani sourc of budget revenu caus resist and skeptic among the public while on the other hand the termin and reduct of ani achiev right to budgetari fund elicit anger and protest becaus of thi we are face with the question of how to balanc the budget without again reach for primari emiss and avoid the chao of last year s hyperinfl the govern shall decis and persist decreas budgetari expenditur howev we also intend to undertak the necessari reform of the taxat system which would have a stimul effect on our economi and lead to larger tax revenu without increas tax rate we shall also strive to encompass the gray economi with the tax word indistinct we shall strive to promot state bond on the capit market as soon as possibl which would contribut to the reduct of our budget deficit without a supplement emiss of money and a new tax burden on the other hand the legal and other oblig that our republ servic from the budget are great particularli oblig toward the level of social and medic protect secur of our citizen and state pension and the unemploy educ scienc and cultur our compatriot in the srpska republ and the republ of serbian krajina and refuge who sought refug in our republ the establish framework for public expenditur as set out in the program must under no circumst be interf with thi mean that the govern must under no circumst give in to ani request and principl for increas the budgetari expenditur howev the assembl also bear it part of the respons for thi we should not insist on legisl that would impos new oblig on the republ and for which fund have not been earmark in the budget the same type of restrict should also appli to tax exempt no tax relief can be approv unless it scope is establish and the lost budget revenu is made up for in other way there is room for decreas public expenditur the constitut ha transfer to the republ mani of the function that use to be in domain of municip or variou self manag associ allianc organ institut and chamber thank to inertia much of thi unnecessari load ha been maintain until today mani of these unnecessari expens stem from irrat behavior in the system of the health and educ institut in the government apparatu and elsewher the govern is determin to remov these concret program will be introduc to ration and reduc all that cannot be accept in the sphere of public expenditur with our current low nation incom the same is envisag for public enterpris their role is to ensur on an econom sound basi the work of the economi and the life of the citizen and not to conceal the multitud of irration and weak behind their frequent monopolist behavior a polici of balanc the budget must be implement in order to increas public incom i believ that everi tax measur of the govern will come under a critic gaze and the govern will treat such critic respons howev the govern will stand firm when it come to everyon have to pay tax provid of cours that tax are in line with the econom abil of the taxpay on the other hand citizen have to know where their money is go and how even the last dinar is spent the govern will abid by the propos and program suggest that tax rate should not be increas but rather that the tax base and the number of taxpay be extend in implement the polici of balanc the budget the govern is determin to establish the strictest of budgetari disciplin and will cooper close with the feder govern and the montenegrin govern that is whi we call on you deputi in thi assembl and the public in gener to extend your full support to thi polici the polici of healthi currenc will repres the main impetu to all the econom activ and the realist increas of the social product in stabl condit without much involv or sponsorship by the state and it bodi room will be made for free entrepreneur and econom initi the place where realist econom calcul is possibl are place where solid product and success trade will also be possibl in other word the aim of the govern is to creat an atmospher in which the market motiv for product will strengthen i beg you for your attent you will have a chanc colleagu deputi to particip as much as you like later on instead of have illus about product and new invest base on the currenc issu a market system will be creat in which everyon will be motiv and econom forc to produc and sell as much as he can the bitter experi of the last few year have taught us that motiv product from the primari issu inflict the most damag on that veri product anoth chanc should not be given to those who still do not believ thi such lesson have alreadi cost too much for that reason all compani will have to establish themselv on the ground of realist econom criteria none of them should expect ani more state subsidi from the budget or the currenc issu they should themselv becom an import sourc of budgetari incom and new invest i suggest to compani that expect thi rather than through their own product that they will find a solut in state subsidi and word indistinct directli or through the trade union that they should immedi chang their manag sinc the govern will not accept ani financ without back or ani other form of deviat from the program a healthi economi even if it is temporarili poor still ha great possibl to exploit the resourc avail and becom rich while an unhealthi economi that is financ without back can never becom that that is whi there is no altern to the polici of a healthi and stabl currenc and that is whi the govern will not give up on thi polici at ani cost the govern s agricultur polici will also be in line with the spirit of the fundament commit in the program thi mean that the agricultur and the food industri will be place in the same condit of product as other field there will be full equal of all properti relat and stimul measur will be introduc that will motiv the merg of agricultur properti and the develop of farm by give full freedom to the develop of co oper by secur protect price for the basic agricultur product and by introduc other form of develop motiv here too there can be no return to financ without back agricultur product will be support onli from realist resourc and with firm guarante with the aim of stimul product better suppli and strengthen the posit of the new dinar the most import issu now is the increas of traffic both by access reserv and by exchang compani foreign currenc for new dinar the govern shall insist that the process of exchang compani and bank foreign currenc is expedit without ani administr restrict in order to make it possibl for product and trade to on the basi of their financi potenti acquir fresh fund necessari for carri out busi function sentenc as heard those compani that alreadi have good program should be given immedi support they should immedi begin realiz these program includ product for export howev the impress is that some of the bank have still not adapt to these condit the measur of the monetari polici should establish condit for bank to respect the need for reason real interest rate and as soon as possibl that is one of the key prerequisit for increas product on market principl the settlement of debt and the reinstat of trust in bank and other financi institut is to a signific degre link to solv the problem of old foreign currenc save serbia will not allow a singl one of it foreign currenc saver to be depriv of hi or her foreign currenc invest or it valu in dinar concret solut for thi problem will be propos in a rel short while the move of social polici outsid the domain of the compani and base on thi the strengthen of their competit edg is a veri import aim of the entir program it is known that a great number of temporarili unemploy worker object are not particip in the product process and that thi ha been so for some time they are now essenti receiv welfar from their compani the state and not the compani must secur welfar and secur for the citizen and the unemploy the state must primarili help the worker who have been laid off by help them to chang their profess and through altern employ moreov pay out the incom of unemploy worker in the form of welfar taken from the state budget rather than the compani would repres a more ration solut if noth els becaus it would elimin the cost that aris from keep in busi unprofit compani and fictiti employ howev we are not focus on lay off the surplu of employe we are talk about a gradual process of structur chang with a stress on an activ polici of new real rather than fictiti employ of peopl along with respect the fact that there are peopl among the employ who have their own capit land or other sourc of incom and who are take up the place of those for whom their job are the onli sourc of incom the govern will be activ involv in the process of collect negoti about salari that goe on between labor union and the chamber of commerc howev we wish to have the smallest possibl amount of administr and regul sentenc as heard salari within the economi as a whole should be freeli form and it is up to the govern to in accord with the budget restrict regul salari in busi that do not produc anyth in and public compani the initi phase of the program primarili focus on the reviv of the nation currenc howev at the same time it mark the begin of a last reviv of the economi onc a market ambienc is establish it basic outlin the state will have it real role in regul econom life the state will devot itself to organ and protect the econom and civil organ and the basic market institut which along with conduct econom polici is it basic but in our societi neglect role what we have in mind here is primarili the protect of contract and properti and the protect of the monetari and fiscal system institut of the good labor and capit market in connect with thi i call on the feder parliament to pass as soon as possibl crucial econom and system law that will put into oper the market econom condit sentenc as heard these are primarili law on compani employ the capit market and the transform of properti we shall propos a new law word indistinct which we believ will be democrat publicli control and social accept the basic principl on which thi law will be base are the autonomi of the compani in make decis on the transform of properti the realist valu of the capit the open of the model and the stimul qualiti and just as for the region develop polici the govern in accord with the program will implement it in such a way that it will primarili insist on the activ of the number of alreadi built but unexploit capac at the same time the govern will concentr resourc for the develop of the infrastructur primarili in the underdevelop region in order to creat favor condit for potenti investor in the context of such a develop polici the particular advantag will be given to kosovo and metohija but we have to stress that the program doe not allow except so the failur to use the exist capac cannot be replac by constant demand for new invest the control function of the state are of a particular import for the implement of the program the govern will prepar a special program for the organiz and the personnel strengthen of the inspect and the financ polic control of the monetari and the crimin sphere will be conduct togeth with the feder govern which will hamper the illeg transact and trade as for the judiciari which is to provid the necessari protect for citizen entrepreneur and therefor the program the chang in the feder and serbian legislatur will provid for the radic sanction of econom and financi offens the safeti of the citizen and the secur of their properti will be in futur too a prioriti of the govern the previou activ of the ministri of intern affair in the extrem complex condit of neighbor war have secur a stabl secur situat in the republ further modern and the constant adjust of thi servic to the chang in the countri and around is a task the govern will deal with regularli esteem peopl deputi by devot itself to the task that the execut author have in a legal state the serbian govern will make everi effort in accord with the law and the constitut to carri out the respons it ha taken on at thi difficult moment to implement the program of monetari reconstruct and the econom recoveri of our countri togeth with the feder govern and the montenegrin govern the program which ha been built on the basi of a market economi ha drawn a line between the compet treat all sector of economi equal the success of the reform demand from everyon to respond to the duti in their line of work thi mean that the economi will have to turn to the product and to reli fulli on it own initi and entrepreneurship the social servic will have to show a greater degre of respons and effici the state administr will have to work more expertli and react more quickli in elimin the obstacl in the consist implement of the program and a higher degre of readi in fight crime of all kind and in elimin war profit the citizen are given a particularli import role without their full confid their accept of the program and their understand for the inevit teeth difficulti without their respons to their tax and other duti the implement of the program would undoubtedli encount further difficulti becaus of the seriou chang it bring with it the program ha in my opinion histor import it ha such import particularli as a mean for the defens of the sovereignti of the countri it ha taken great courag for us to commit ourselv to a convert dinar at time of an econom blockad and succeed in defend it for it part the serbian govern stress it firm resolut in persev in the consist implement of the program of monetari reform and econom recoveri the govern is awar that the organ of the government bodi ha to be improv and they have to be made respons for carri out task in line with that the govern will undertak a seri of oper measur and will organ a system to observ the implement of the program in order to react promptli to transgress as they occur i am convinc that we are all awar of the difficulti connect with thi task and of the signific of the period befor us none of us ha ani illus that differ view and attitud can be avoid in a democrat assembl between polit parti and in accord with that that thi program and the polici base on it will easili get the necessari support here i have to stress howev that econom life itself ha almost impos such a program as an altern to the chao of hyperinfl and complet collaps with unpredict econom social and polit consequ that is whi i call on all the parti and the deputi on the behalf of the govern to cooper on thi program whose main orient must not be question at ani time the seriou effort that the govern ha to put in in the next few month and year to achiev econom revit are inde necessari in order to allevi the effect of the sanction these effort will continu to be necessari even after the sanction are lift in order to avoid econom and polit chao to protect domest product from unprincipl rivalri from outsid and to provid all those market product and financi rule that are necessari for an economi to becom more success howev these great and imper effort concern the economi that the govern must undertak should also be accompani by similarli great and imper effort in other sphere of social life health educ scienc cultur and inform the intern blockad undermin not onli the econom life in serbia but the social life as well and for thi reason relat effort are need the intern blockad definit brought about a stagnat in the develop of scienc the provici of cultur educ that is excess turn exclus toward the nation and the past and subject and defeat in the dissemin of inform these are the occurr that more or less cannot be avoid under the condit of a major intern blockad other countri in a similar situat would have behav in a similar manner under the current circumst it is not our task to contribut toward the sanction with our own behavior and while the sanction last even though justli infuri by the world not to turn our back to the world and remain isol and lone for longer than the sanction have been impos in educ for exampl we must make an effort at everi level from school to univers to link ourselv to the greatest achiev and best experi in the develop world the aim of thi linkag would be to prepar the young gener for profession and intellectu activ and for work and life in the third millennium educ must rid itself as quickli and as serious as possibl of the pathet orient toward the nation especi toward the nation past isolation in educ is more danger than econom isolation it consequ are reflect in the idea of the youngest gener and last long after the idea and practic of isolation have pass through educ the young gener must be made capabl of work and live in the come era it must be capabl of critic thi era but also of critic promot it and love it at thi moment scienc ha been entir expos to the danger of stagnat despit the lack of materi and financi resourc and the interrupt of numer institut and person link abroad and despit the confus disillusion and even opportun that can be encount in the humanist scienc the govern will make everi effort to secur greater materi and financi resourc for the develop of scienc in faculti and institut to restor scientif link with europ and the world that can be restor despit the sanction especi onc the sanction are lift and to encourag scientif work in the sphere of natur and social scienc with a polici of grant the publish of scientif public and the creation of an overal atmospher that scienc to a great degre hold the answer on how to lead a richer and more human life today and in the futur cultur as a whole is also a victim of the sanction the war encircl and all the consequ brought on by the countri s disintegr the creation of artwork ha been endang as well as their interpret and convey to other peopl the condit for artist creativ as well make artist and cultur heritag access to as mani peopl as possibl especi young must be radic chang in a posit sens just like educ the art and scienc must turn to the present and the futur to the world and to other cultur they must free themselv from the domin of the past which threaten to make the cultur life provinci and autark radic chang must especi be implement in the sphere of inform dissemin thi is often domin by the air of pessim and defeat bourgeoi and superfici attitud toward societi and it problem especi toward solut for these problem the dissemin of inform is partial respons for the impress that everyon in the world is against the serb and that for these and other reason we do not need anyon thi impress is natur unfound it is not true that everyon is against the serb as it equal not true that the serb can exist by themselv as an econom polit and cultur robinson cruso at least not if they want to be success and happi inform dissemin must be made more object versatil and cultur regard our countri and foreign countri it must bring back optim to the public at least to an extent to which it ha lessen it despit all our problem there is no reason whi thi optim could not be realist thi countri and these peopl have preserv energi digniti and hope under the condit of sanction while thi govern know and respect thi energi digniti and hope will do everyth to free us from the sanction and word indistinct to live human as much as we can under the sanction the govern ha a duti to do thi becaus of the serbian citizen and especi becaus of the young gener which want to live in peac freedom and prosper and which is will to make it contribut toward thi peac freedom and prosper howev it must make it contribut through educ work and creativ such a determin of the young gener is our biggest asset i end my expos in a desir to preserv thi wealth and increas it further applaus
