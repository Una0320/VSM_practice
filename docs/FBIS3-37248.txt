netherland world bank director in moscow fear a catastroph excerpt passag omit ardi stoutjesdijk age 55 a rotterdamm in russia is the director of the world bank s moscow offic how doe he think the stumbl russian economi will fare it is not the best time to ask that question stoutjesdijk said the new chernomyrdin govern ha onli just been form but given the way thing are develop the follow scenario is feasibl a catastroph will take place in three to six month then the last reform will resign and the govern will have to complet revers it polici or an entir new team will replac it perhap they would again be reform stoutjesdijk ad but he did not exclud the possibl that the ultra nationalist and communist opposit would then strike stoutjesdijk came to moscow two year ago from washington and it is onli now that all the logist problem have been solv he said at last we are in a good build he point to hi desk normal these telephon should work the world bank ha sixti offic in lender countri accord to the economist who left the netherland in 1964 and moscow is one of the biggest he ad duk should russia carri out more or less econom reform stoutjesdijk there were a number of posit develop in 1993 like price liber privat and the budgetari polici which were strengthen consider under fedorov thi ha led to a signific drop in inflat the roubl s exchang rate ha been stabl for a long time but some thing did not happen and that is veri bad it is veri neg that agricultur reform fail to occur they start privat veri late in thi sector the agricultur sector is complet domin by larg state compani with a gener reactionari sort of manag passag omit duk can the reform be delay as prime minist chernomyrdin is now suggest stoutjesdijk the number of option is far more limit than gener assum the prioriti remain the inflat problem which is caus a flight of capit lack of invest and loss in purchas power the poor are now abl to pay for just their food and noth more inflat must be curb and therefor in ani event the govern budget must be limit especi in a countri where so much money goe to the defens industri and industri which are link to defens to peopl employ by the govern or in subsidi to other industri view such as chernomyrdin s that the reform can be slow down are onli understand if peopl like him realli believ that anoth way is possibl perhap they think that but often they have not been educ in macro econom duk the condit set by the imf and the world bank are critic becaus they impos an excess social and polit toll there will be massiv unemploy if inflat is tackl hard subsidi and cheap credit are stop and unprofit compani go bankrupt that can caus social unrest and play into the hand of extremist politician like vladimir zhirinovskiy stoutjesdijk our advic is base on experi in a larg number of countri there is practic no econom subject where we have not reach agreement with the reform in russia they even use the imf and world bank as an argument in cabinet meet far reach reform and fight inflat are inde unthink without increas unemploy passag omit duk are those peopl the wrong peopl receiv money in or close to the russian govern stoutjesdijk i would be particularli pleas to know who is get that money duk tell that stori to the averag russian voter and he will immedi vote for far reach reform stoutjesdijk that is also my critic of the reform they have not sold their polici to the peopl well perhap their approach is pain in the short term but in the long term a major will benefit but i must also acknowledg that the sort of advic given to the russian govern and the attitud of the actual reform are strongli influenc by the u s model an orient to western europ could have alreadi reduc the hardest consequ of the reform but social secur ha to be financ and we must not forget that foreign aid ha been far less than promis the aid is mainli provid in the form of debt reschedul to return to the critic that the imf s and world bank s condit are exact too high a toll as yet there is no prospect of measur which would lead to a larg increas in unemploy in fact we are even see that russian product is to be protect that import tariff will increas and there even seem to be talk of possibl price control in brief there is a real possibl that in a few month we will have a situat here which is just as catastroph as that in ukrain or romania perhap thi govern will then see that tough measur are necessari and perhap the russian peopl will accept these measur if they are taken by former communist manag like chernomyrdin these polici are not accept from an academ like gaydar duk anatoliy chubay the liber privat minist ha stay on how import is that stoutjesdijk privat polici are crucial at present between 70 and 80 percent of small enterpris have been privat now the privat of medium size enterpris with less than 25 000 employe is take place that is happen veri quickli everi month between 2 and 3 000 compani are privat the dinosaur of 25 000 employe and over are a problem they are all in a terribl state and as such can scarc be privat sometim whole commun have been built up round such compani if you close the compani then you close the commun these compani will have to continu to be support in the futur you cannot leav that to the market but you can say to their manag in the come year look to see what can be save from such a compani duk what would the world bank do if russian polici chang significantli stoutjesdijk if we see that thing are becom disastr here then we will have to modifi our lend polici should there be an arrear in repay then we would stop look of cours we understand too that all polici must have a basi in societi for exampl there wa a big conflict between reform and the old conserv parliament on the desir of loan and set up the privat program but here i am with the hard fact that i have 2 5 billion avail for variou project includ 500 million for reorgan agricultur whether and how thi is to be use depend on the polit will in russia
