inaugur last august it is insist on make chang what are the chang made in your ministri quiroga there are three basic aspect we want to chang in the transit from the old interior ministri to the new govern ministri the first one is relat to the intellig servic which terrifi the peopl in the past thi wa the part of the state that investig the possibl of a coup of sedit but we now believ that under a modern and establish democraci like our these servic must contribut to peopl s secur and along with it basic organ which is the polic should be the support of the bolivian peopl to give them daili secur we are work on it the first step taken is to institution the intellig servic and put them in the hand of the polic in order to prevent them from becom an instrument of the polit power that happen to be in charg of the govern ministri canipa is there no longer a govern ministri intellig servic quiroga there is an intellig servic in the govern ministri that depend on the polic and all it member are part of the bolivian polic thi is close link to the chang in the polic as part of the first aspect passag omit canipa what will happen with the struggl against drug traffick will it be includ in these chang quiroga of cours to start with we have chang the social defens secretariat which in the past wa exclus link to the issu of coca and cocain it now ha a wider role involv prevent and interdict although interdict wa an import role in the past we believ altern develop is also an essenti issu it will not be possibl to achiev an adequ replac for surplu coca product if we are not abl to find an econom solut the onli way that an individu who grow coca stop do it is when he realiz that grow anoth product is more profit than grow coca from the econom point of view thi is what we are work on we have taken control of the fund for altern develop by chang it structur we creat an execut board presid over by a deleg of the presid of the republ and it respons is share by the execut branch and coca produc we would like to see the execut board creat the idea to carri out altern develop erad will be link to altern develop in those place where erad is be carri out there will be altern develop and where altern develop took place it wa becaus there wa a reduct in coca grow but i am not say that we will elimin interdict we will continu the work be carri out in the countri but interdict will be exclus against drug traffick not against coca grower or peopl involv in the legal commerci of coca we have a special antinarcot forc felcn that is an exampl for latin america and we will continu to support it becaus we believ that interdict is essenti we also will carri out prevent as an overal part of our strategi and thi is whi we creat the social prevent under secretariat which will deal with alcohol drug addict and crime thi organ will help tri to prevent these evil in societi through teach program canipa to talk about success and real altern develop not just in speech the way it is now mean talk about resourc how will you financ the altern develop project to becom a realiti quiroga we are talk about three basic sourc of financ the first is the resourc that drug traffick itself produc the countri ha mani resourc from drug traffick that are lost with time we are talk about a great deal of money mani asset that have been disappear the one respons wa first the interior ministri later it wa a share respons between prosecutor and the interior ministri now it is the respons of prosecutor and the judg who hand over the asset to truste who later disappear we will propos that the legisl branch chang the law to be abl to immedi auction confisc asset to creat a common fund to support the peopl found innoc after their asset were confisc with thi fund we hope to financ 30 to 35 percent of the altern develop program the second resourc will be multin organ the unit nation and the inter american develop bank are interest in carri out altern develop program under the concept that the onli way to do it adequ is through the industri of the area where surplu coca is grown the third financ resourc is the unit state with bilater aid that countri gave about 20 million to 25 million annual for altern develop but a larg part of those resourc were use to pay salari and not necessarili to carri out altern develop with these three resourc which are not from the nation treasuri in addit to some fund from the nation budget we believ we can carri out a good altern develop polici canipa regard interdict there ha been a great deal of talk about the presenc of colombian drug traffick in bolivia is that true quiroga we have inform about new technolog the technolog use in the countri is differ from that use by the medellin and cali cartel but in the last two year we have seen that the technolog to produc coca and cocain in the countri ha quickli improv and thi make the narcot intellig organ think there is perman and decis cooper by the colombian drug cartel anoth aspect is that probabl 80 percent of the drug produc in the countri goe to colombia whether it goe to paraguay argentina or brazil it final destin is colombia where the last stage of purif is made befor it is sent to the unit state perhap thi is the most import reason to continu with interdict to prevent colombian drug traffick from establish themselv in our countri canipa doe thi repres a threat of violenc quiroga without ani doubt thi may repres violenc becaus the mafia is violent and we will not send nun from a convent to fight against them we must send outstand offic against them becaus thi is a war a war in which the govern the polic have to fulfil the law when the other side violat them drug traffick violat sovereignti hurt the popul by threaten them and they also murder with impun it is an unjust struggl becaus one side ha law and regul to fulfil while the other side ha absolut no restrict canipa do you have a list of the main drug traffick in the countri who head the list quiroga we have a perman list that undergo chang base on the arrest made the number one in the countri is meco dominguez who receiv a sentenc and ha escap he is at larg there is also a list of nine individu who are a number one prioriti for felcn onli two month ago the number one on that list wa nando gutierrez who wa captur as you can see it is a list that chang period we have a felcn that is veri effici but the dea s cooper in thi work must be recogn
