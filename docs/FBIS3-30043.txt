languag f p 105 japanes f articl type bfn text a piec of iron hover in the air the kanagawa academi of scienc and technolog kast establish by kanagawa prefectur ha discov a new magnet levit phenomenon that use high temperatur superconductor and confirm that practic use are possibl previous it wa imposs to levit someth unless a perman magnet wa use togeth with a superconductor howev thi new phenomenon ha overthrown the belief of the past the new techniqu can keep a piec of iron in the air as if it were hang from someth abov iron is stronger and less expens than perman magnet therefor it will be much easier than befor to find applic for thi magnet levit techniqu which use a superconductor the kast and a superconduct research institut invest in by the govern and the privat sector will start a joint project to develop magnet bear by appli thi new phenomenon the research who discov thi new phenomenon are toshiro toiguchi who is tokyo univers engin depart professor and leader of the toiguchi project for ultim mechatron a word made by combin the word mechan and electron accord to a japanes dictionari issu by kodansha and yukio tsutsui a research with yasukawa electr manufactur compani the new phenomenon use a perman magnet onli at the initi prepar stage but the perman magnet is not use after the state of superconduct is reach to start with a perman magnet is place near but not in contact with a high temperatur superconductor as in the convent method the high temperatur superconductor when cool memor the magnet forc emit by the perman magnet becaus of thi the superconductor and the magnet maintain a certain distanc without touch each other the superconductor continu to emit magnet forc even after the perman magnet is remov after thi the magnet is replac with a strong ferromagnet substanc such as iron in thi new method thi is where it differ from the convent method which levit object use a perman magnet or levit and move object along a rail made by place magnet side by side it is necessari to make the cross section of the iron near the superconductor smaller than that of the remov perman magnet by do thi the draw forc which is determin by the ratio of thi cross section gross weight of iron and magnet flux densiti becom stabl it wa thought in the past that iron would be drawn to the superconductor or fall due to it weight use the new method howev it is possibl to make the iron hover in the air some distanc from the superconductor the new method can also prevent the iron from slide sideway the new technolog discov by kast can be categor as a hang type it draw forc keep the iron in the air as if it were hang from the superconductor it may not be call levit howev it is levit as far as it practic applic are concern dure the experi the research succeed in hang a 79 gram piec of iron whose cross section wa 8 mm in diamet maintain a distanc of between 0 5 to 1 0 mm from the superconductor the levit forc were one fifth those use a perman magnet howev it is by no mean inferior to levit forc obtain by use a perman magnet as far as it possibl applic are concern
