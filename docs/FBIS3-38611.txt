the strong support of administr profession the rkp too had doubt about it own candid at first about whom they probabl would not have complain but whose campaign would cost a lot of money after give it some thought they conclud that it would be good for the parti to put in an appear in the presidenti elect and acquir finnish languag voter but there are onli a coupl of littl thing that constitut a burden on rehn s way to mantyniemi presid s resid her first languag her parti her sex her famili background and the prejudic associ with them she ha been pigeonhol as mr rehn of kauniainen h5 toucher
