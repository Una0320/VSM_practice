jericho is not as great as newspap report claim it ha becom a phenomenon that demand attent studi and debat as well as treatment the import and graviti of the situat lie in the upcom isra withdraw from gaza and jericho and the implement of autonomi in those two area with the start of the five year transit phase accord to the declar of principl the oslo accord sign in the white hous garden last 13 septemb it import and graviti also lie in the fact that some peopl anticip that it could if it continu lead to a civil war along the line of what happen in afghanistan or somalia there may be a good deal of exagger in such expect as mani palestinian say both support and oppon of the accord they attribut it to variou caus the natur of the palestinian peopl their level of polit awar and the fact that the isra will not be withdraw complet from the occupi territori henc the spread of thi quantiti of arm between 10 15 000 weapon accord to one fatah offici especi in the gaza strip the fact that these arm are reach the hand of citizen wari of the futur and afraid of the unknown creat fear and uneas among those who hope that thi will not lead to a civil war or to arm clash between faction or even insid a singl organ to settl old score they could be use for reveng arm robberi and theft which have recent been on the rise and then there is israel s attempt to exploit the situat stir up troubl and use their agent to foil the autonomi experi in order to shed some light on thi phenomenon al sharq al awsat ask palestinian offici from six major palestinian faction and parti plu some independ figur a number of question about the extent of the spread of arm the reason motiv consequ the sourc of the arm and the role of the palestinian polic in contain them what follow are the repli

ilya frayj independ wahid al hamdulillah a well known independ nation figur and a member of the board of regent of al najah univers in nablu and zuhayr al rayyi a writer journalist nation known figur and promin person in the gaza strip salih how widespread are weapon in the occupi territori is it as great as the newspap say abu mahir fatah there are an estim 10 15 000 weapon and that could rise mostli in the gaza strip al nazal hama i doubt that there is ani great spread of arm it is extrem difficult to obtain arm to fight the occup and thi is a major obstacl we have report that confirm that the alleg about the abnorm spread of arm are untru al khatib peopl s parti there is a widespread larg scale spread of arm particularli in the gaza strip and in the occupi territori as a whole it is not onli a problem of the extent of the spread but of the lack of ani control over who is stockpil these arm of cours some polit organ obtain arm but there are also other group and individu that get them if they can afford them dawud al tilhami dflp perhap there is some exagger about the volum of arm in the occupi territori especi in gaza thi exagger is intend to creat a climat of fear for the resid of gaza at a time when the occup forc are prepar to pull out of the citi and camp and redeploy in the site specifi in the cairo accord between arafat and pere al shu aybi dpu the spread of arm is rel to how it wa in the past what is remark is the transform in thi phenomenon now to a virtual public one especi in the gaza strip one cannot speak of thi type of phenomenon exist in the west bank but there is a notic increas in the buy and sell of arm and a bold in carri them al shaqaqi islam jihad the spread of arm is aim at the gaza strip and to a lesser extent the citi of nablu in the west bank thi is not new nor is it on the scale alleg by newspap report what is new is the open with which peopl are bear arm especi fatah member thi come after the oslo accord wherebi the author no longer hold fatah peopl respons specif for bear arm some famili histor known for own arm for trade in them or other purpos are no longer afraid to display them most of them are small light arm and by our estim do not exceed the volum of the arm in the hand of all the faction and famili by more than a few hundr weapon dr awwad independ there are sever reason whi arm are more widespread in the gaza strip than in the west bank but there are no precis estim about thi regard the spread of arm in gaza in particular it is now said jokingli that arm are sold by the bushel like fruit and veget in gaza but the truth is that there is a notic rise in armament with hundr of gun like kalashnikov uzi and pistol reach gaza frayj independ there is no accur inform about the volum of arm talk on thi subject is exagger al hamdulillah independ where there is smoke there is fire gun have begun to appear openli especi in the gaza strip and much more wide than wa normal in the year of intifadah but the report be circul are not accur and do not present a reliabl or realist pictur al rayyi independ thi phenomenon ha becom clear and well known it ha been acknowledg by isra prime minist yitzhaq rabin in offici report i believ that the quantiti of arm in peopl s hand are increas day by day despit the continu warn of the danger of thi phenomenon and the neg effect it might have especi in gaza salih the caus and motiv behind the spread of arm do the faction have a hand in thi abu mahir there are mani and vari reason for thi phenomenon which i would summar as follow first the occup and it continu presenc dure the transit period and our peopl s belief that there will be no withdraw unless the enemi is forc out by forc of arm second the sens of a need for protect from settler attack and their crime which now occur under the veri nose of the occup soldier third the attack of arm gang on peopl and properti and crime commit by peopl claim to belong to palestinian faction fourth the spread of rumor about interfact fight onc the transit period begin al nazal we believ that the most import reason for the purchas of arm is confront with the occup author and i repeat that there is no phenomenon of widespread arm al khatib there are a number of reason for the spread of arm first their avail from isra sourc through the black market and the underworld gang in israel second citizen feel of insecur and uneas third the uncertain futur fourth the exist of rivalri at time among polit faction fifth israel s reduct of monitor and punish of peopl transport arm or possess them especi in gaza al tilhami natur a larg number of intifadah fighter had arm especi in the last three year thi wa a distinct increas to confront the occup in recent month especi after the oslo accord there have been more gun in gaza both smuggl in from sinai or bought from arm deal network in the occupi territori of cours in light of the mount chao in gaza it wa natur for organ palestinian forc to provid the arm necessari for self defens against occup attack settler oper or occup agent we do not rule out that the isra use their access to arm deal network might be tri to turn polit disput among the faction into arm clash thi is someth we serious and firmli warn against al shu aybi histor the nation movement ha sought to obtain arm to use them in milit oper they use to smuggl the arm in in recent year face with the difficulti of smuggl they have resort to obtain arm from isra dealer in the underworld they get arm stolen from isra camp after the madrid negoti and israel s willing to withdraw from gaza the isra fist began to get lax in it rule and control and thi phenomenon encourag a larg number of peopl to buy arm and start deal in them the state of intensifi polar among faction after madrid and oslo aid the wish to strengthen everi faction and veri openli in societi to increas the traffick and sometim the transport of arm stock in the west bank and gaza directli to the market for sale they took advantag of the high price that result from the worsen financi condit of mani social faction and faction member after the plo cut off their financi aid al shaqaqi the enemi is help fatah to get weapon for it member sinc these arm no longer pose a threat to israel some fatah element have begun to traffic in arm there are other fight faction who want to buy arm either to fight the enemi or for self defens thi is rather limit becaus arm are expens and there is a limit suppli on the other hand some famili have begun to fear for the live of their children in the come phase about which noth is clear so they want to protect themselv some of these famili previous own gun which they are now bring out to use in famili or organiz problem dr awwad i think the main reason for the spread of arm is to settl score for self defens and the polit struggl within some of the major group in the plo there are score to be settl among famili and organ in addit to fear and the wish for self defens fear of a secur vacuum when the withdraw begin these reason have led some person to leav gaza for egypt until thing settl down frayj i think it unlik that the faction have ani desir to see arm spread al hamdulillah we in the occupi territori accus the occup author and their intellig servic of play a secret and danger role in the spread of thi phenomenon these author have recent begun to arm their collabor more openli and on a wider scale to defend themselv instead of move them behind the so call green line pre 1967 border there is no doubt howev that the transfer of author which ha not yet occur may be seen as one of the major caus for thi phenomenon add to that the famili feud the assassin of collabor and the rivalri over power center all these have made some peopl keep gun handi for self defens some other of cours carri gun to combat the occup in short the polici of the occup author and the vacuum creat after the withdraw could result some believ in an interest in gun stem from fear of the futur i person do not think that the faction have ani hand in thi al rayyi the divers faction have their own reason and motiv that compel them to stockpil what arm they can gather thi is in spite of the constant assur that there will be no fight among brother and that the govern will be reason and logic but what make the situat danger is the spread of arm among ordinari citizen who imagin that these weapon are necessari to safeguard their secur and safeti and to confront the unknown salih what are the sourc of these arm abu mahir recent most arm have come from southern lebanon via arm dealer and through collus with occup offic al nazal there are numer sourc for obtain arm it vari from faction to faction hama s princip sourc of arm is the occup soldier kill by al qassam hero who take their gun al khatib israel is encourag thi phenomenon al tilhami as i mention previous most of these arm come from arm dealer and even the occup soldier some of whom sell arm for materi gain there is a certain quantiti of arm smuggl in from sinai al shu aybi in the likud era israel made it easi for some of the group oppos to plo faction to obtain small arm specif in the gaza strip the negoti encourag palestinian and isra to start traffick in arm across the egyptian border al shaqaqi we believ that the phenomenon is a limit one it is not as newspap report portray it the suppli is meager and the high price are stagger the cost of a gun sinc the sign of the oslo accord ha not gone down one cent the price of a revolv is the equival of 3 000 a kalashnikov is 7 000 and a u s made m 16 is at least 10 000 the sourc of the gun are as follow 1 the theft of isra own car especi in the territori occupi sinc 1948 most of these car have gun insid 2 arm smuggl over the egyptian border 3 drug dealer who trade drug to isra soldier in exchang for their gun which are then sold 4 some bedouin in beersheba have famili connect in gaza and bring arm to their rel 5 arm stolen from isra armi stockpil or settlement 6 arm store sinc 1967 which are reappear now these are egyptian gun whose owner want to sell them and profit from high price befor it is too late and they lose their valu dr awwad there are a number of sourc there are isra arm dealer well known to the isra author there are arm stockpil collect over the long year for use at the proper time which for some ha now arriv and there are arm smuggl over the egyptian border frayj if the report are true the peopl fuel thi phenomenon are the enemi of the palestinian peopl al hamdulillah in my view the sourc are restrict to the follow the remaind of the arm left behind by the arab armi in the 1967 war gun smuggl over the border of egypt syria lebanon and jordan and isra sourc includ the arm of collabor al rayyi recent a gun tote palestinian youth wa shown on isra televis answer a report s question by say that sinc it is now possibl to move peopl and car in and out of gaza it isn t difficult to take in a littl gun that could easili be hidden from ani sourc and by ani mean it may be said that the arm sourc are the isra intellig servic isra soldier the bedouin and smuggl from jordan and the sinai salih what might be the outcom of thi spread of arm could it reach the point of civil war as some report say abu mahir apart from the motiv of those who promot gun or facilit their suppli to citizen these arm are patriot and palestinian when possess by our peopl they will eventu be use against the soldier of the occup and the settler there is no danger of gun ownership lead to a civil war becaus a gun by itself is not a condit for civil war which ha it own caus term and motiv these factor and condit do not exist there are no ethnic divis or sectarian conflict among our peopl gun in our peopl s hand frighten the occup soldier settler and agent and give citizen self confid especi when secur is lack as is the case befor the transfer of power to the palestinian al nazal i do not believ that combat bear arm against the occup will lead to civil war i believ in the good sens and ethic of our peopl in manag and solv it problem time past are the best proof of thi the strang thing here is that one polit movement in support of the oslo and cairo accord that is arafat s group is behind the alleg about the abnorm spread of arm and it be blown out of proport in the media we have not heard anyth about there be someth scari about the spread of arm from ani opposit faction in addit exagger is part of the campaign arafat s group is wage to get want person to turn themselv in along with their gun to the occup author al khatib it is to be fear that thi phenomenon may increas the chanc that peopl will resort to arm in ani polit or tribal or even person disput there is also the danger of the spread of vendetta and vengeanc especi given the assassin of those accus of collabor without ani trial or investig of the charg in most case final there is the likelihood that it will be difficult to control the situat when the plo and the palestinian polic go into gaza i believ that thi is israel s goal in encourag thi phenomenon al tilhami we do not rule out that the occup author might intend to somalia or afghan the gaza strip and creat violent anarchi and civil war in order to keep palestinian forc oppos to the oslo cairo accord from continu their resist to the occup it would also weaken the upris against the occup and give the impress that the palestinian peopl are unabl to handl their polit relat and disput in a ration manner for our part we will foil the isra plan and do everyth in our power to prevent a civil war we will keep all gun point at the enemi and keep polit disput within limit give the mass a voic in them al shu aybi the spread of thi phenomenon apart from it direct aim behind which some of the isra secur servic may lurk is an attempt to posit it aim and outcom neg to hasten the outbreak of internecin fight and creat an unstabl social situat prevent the natur transform of palestinian societi into an independ state and to push the peopl into accept ani solut even an annexationist one particularli as the trial run will be in gaza and can affect the peopl s posit in the west bank later and in the diaspora too it would be hard for a civil war to break out between faction becaus public opinion is against it but it would be possibl to caus famili conflict and at time intern fight within a singl faction al shaqaqi the exist of a few hundr gun cannot ignit a civil war if famili feel that their children are safe there will be no danger in these famili own gun but we must consid that some of these famili have member with differ organiz loyalti and affili thi is especi true with famili loyal to the opposit becaus of their member loyalti here the autonom author come into play if it behav as an oppress power as mani fear it will then the problem will come to a head but i rule out civil war there is anoth point i want to explain that the isra armi ha act offici so far to spread arm ye it ha eas up a littl in some area but not to the point of be respons for spread the phenomenon if that were the case there would be more gun and they would be cheaper i am afraid that the isar armi s accus is the prelud to repress of those who are bear arm against the enemi today and buy them with their food money or their children s to defend their countri and their land dr awwad arm struggl and intern purg within major organ have been attribut to thi phenomenon thi phenomenon will serv to increas the opposit s arm oper against settler and the isra armi when the withdraw begin the spread of arm will escal the arm struggl between support and oppon of the settlement these confront could escal into a civil war in the event the palestinian author is unabl to creat polit channel for solv disput by democrat mean frayj it make no sens whatsoev for palestinian faction to ignit a civil war al hamdulillah i would like to say frankli and with certainti that we do not sens or see ani competit or rivalri in the occupi territori or ani struggl to obtain arm so i do not agre with those who are afraid that thi will lead to a civil war everyon know that the enemi is present there and not move i do not believ that the palestinian side will lose their reason or ration thi doe not mean that there may not be some undesir and unaccept or even danger practic and violat but the occupi desir for palestinian infight and civil war will not be satisfi our peopl suffer under occup and follow the cours of event silent will not forgiv those who harm or squander their right al rayyi the spread of arm is push event to the edg of the abyss and rais doubt about all the assur about good intent and the genuin desir for a solut to conflict through dialogu with higher interest prevail after that the disciplin we need becom difficult and will requir redoubl effort on the part of everyon who want to avoid collaps and deterior salih and the role of the palestinian polic in contain thi phenomenon when they take over secur affair after the evacu of the isra forc from the occupi territori abu mahir unquestion when the palestinian polic take up their duti they will have an import and basic role in creat an atmospher of secur and stabil among citizen they must also build nation uniti provid social justic and establish democraci in societi and it institut and enforc the law among the peopl these factor will lead to an atmospher of self control among citizen help them to control and regul arm prevent infract and turn the arm phenomenon into a posit factor help the author to establish secur and deter violenc when israel withdraw it armi and settler from the occupi area al nazal we are afraid the arafat group s talk about the arm phenomenon is just a prelud to the repress of oppon and disarm them to prevent them from fight the enemi in accord with the promis they made israel about ceas militari oper i believ that thi is the real motiv behind thi overblown campaign warn of so call danger al khatib when the palestinian polic assum their secur respons they should take arm away from individu and group except those who have offici task assign them by the govern or the secur servic there must be strict control on the transport and possess of arm most importantli a feel of secur must be creat for citizen to put an end to ani motiv for possess or use arm al tilhami we are afraid after read the provis of the oslo and cairo accord that the so call palestinian polic will be entrust with the mission of repress the intifadah and the peopl thi is someth the occup forc have been unabl to do for the more than six year of the intifadah we do not rule out that the promot of anarchi crimin theft and the terror of citizen in gaza might open the way for the palestinian group that sign the oslo and cairo accord to be put to the test control the intifadah and repress it peopl thi is what make us fear the content and provis of those two accord to which we are total oppos they do not ensur withdraw from the occupi territori so we will work with all opposit patriot and islam forc group and person includ member of fatah and the palestin peopl s parti who oppos the cairo accord in order to reject thi mission entrust to the so call palestinian polic we reject the transform of thi bodi into an instrument of oppress against the peopl to serv a plan to repress the intifadah and provid secur for the occup instad of erad it al shu aybi the palestinian polic in the context of public law and order will limit the consequ of arm purchas even if they cannot put an end to arm purchas itself dr awwad the palestinian author will not succeed in collect arm from organ and the populac becaus that would lead to a clash that would not be in it interest plu the fact that disarm the opposit would be seen as cooper and collus with israel that would certainli lead to an open confront between the author and opposit forc frayj he did not respond to thi question al hamdulillah thi question would be better put to the leadership that conclud the oslo accord with israel and subsequ the cairo accord on form the palestinian polic and the mission with which the isra entrust them so excus me for not answer thi question al rayyi the ordinari palestinian look veri posit upon the palestinian polic and have great hope in it they have confid that they will repres disciplin the law and human right and with the same strength and to the same degre they see them as a forc for maintain public order and not just the system of autonomi
