languag f p 105 russian f articl type cso f p 106 articl by nikolay kishkin what to think about in the f duma the first post soviet parliament will begin it work next week text the central elector commiss of russia ha final publish the final result of the elect behind us are the tension and confus of the preelect week and the disson of the first frequent excess emot postelect assess it is alreadi possibl to take a calmer look at what ha happen and to think about what to expect from the new parliament and how it activ will be reflect in our life the first conclus to be drawn from look at the list of elect deputi is perhap simpl there were no winner in these elect no singl bloc and no singl parti receiv a major in parliament or even an appreci preponder the preelect predict of almost all of them were two to five time greater than what they actual receiv perhap onli zhirinovskiy s ldpr liber democrat parti of russia with all of it ambit wa not count on such an impress number of vote so the zhirinovskiy phenomenon consist not in hi victori as it turn out in term of gener result he did not have one but in the unexpected of hi success right after the fact thi success wa explain by a multitud of factor includ extrem one from an affin for neo nazi slogan on the part of a low life and young supermen to mass hypnosi by the kashpirovskiy method but the essenc probabl consist in the fact that while there wa no singl reason for the success of the ldpr final what wa decis wa the dissatisfact of a consider part of the popul with the current situat and their standard of live of cours question immedi aris whi did thi voter give hi vote to zhirinovskiy and not for exampl to travkin who with govorukhin s help wa critic the govern almost down to hi last word and in spite of thi bare pass the 5 percent mark whi did thi voter not see the danger of the neo nazi slogan and recoil from their author whi did he buy these promis which he knew could not be kept and the answer is simpl and obviou becaus sever gener of our peopl have been educ in a belief in simpl and clear solut and these are what zhirinovskiy offer after all did we not believ at the begin of almost ani five year plan that at the end of it there would be a burst of prosper were there not mani peopl who believ nikita sergeyevich when he said that commun would arriv in 20 year so whi not believ vladimir volfovich now thank to the parti and the govern thi is not simpli a slogan of those year it is a level of belief in the idea that someon will give us someth it is the way of think of the mass of peopl of cours one can say that a certain part of the voter did not have enough polit sophist to figur all thi out ye one could say that but it is wrong to blame the voter for thi for decad they had no polit choic when they went to vote and if now without get into the intricaci of polit a person ha made hi choic at the level of a naiv everyday awar it is hi choic and now the politician will have to deal with it the paradox of the recent elect consist in that while there are no winner there are still loser and unfortun they are the reform bloc if after count on a major in parliament they do not receiv it you cannot call it anyth but a defeat and now all parliamentari tactic will have to be arrang in a new way base on exist realiti how will the breakdown of polit forc in the duma look and how will the bloc behav let us stipul at the outset that a final conclus about the align of forc will not be possibl until after there have been two or three vote on fundament issu in the first place a consider share of the deputi were elect as independ they are not bound to ani bloc and therefor their propens may be reveal onli dure the process of the parliament s work in the second place even those who ran under the banner of a specif bloc will certainli not necessarili vote on one question or anoth in line with thi bloc s program it is now possibl to construct supposit about the tactic of these bloc as a whole with a greater or lesser degre of probabl russia s choic accord to initi estim will be the largest faction includ more than 100 deputi which howev is clearli not enough to confid defend the cours of reform therefor thi cours can be maintain without special fluctuat onli with cooper with the yavlinskiy shakhray and women of russia bloc along with independ deputi the leader of the russia s choic bloc have alreadi announc their readi to interact in parliament with all polit forc but even then a major is not guarante in search of thi major the bloc will obvious be prepar to make partial concess except for those that would mean a reject of the reform that have been start and thi present a major difficulti for even the bloc of yavlinskiy and shakhray which are kindr in spirit diverg from gaydar s bloc fundament with respect to a number of econom problem particularli concern the speed of the reform and social prioriti an extrem impress forc is repres by the team of the agrarian parti and the communist parti of the russian feder which togeth receiv more than 110 one can obvious argu about thi but i lump them togeth becaus to be honest i see no special differ in their polit posit their orient toward socialist valu bind them firmli togeth in their vote it is from thi team retain reformist phraseolog that there may come propos that essenti exacerb inflat such as price regul support for fail enterpris in the citi and countri that is the veri propos that could mean an end to the reform and ukrainian of the russian economi the danger of such propos is fairli great if one consid that on the surfac they appear to be concern for the public good and can attract a certain part of the deputi strang as it may be with respect to a number of issu thi team might be join by the democrat parti of russia which is head by anticommunist travkin and govorukhin have assum dure the elect campaign a tone that wa not simpli critic but abus to the reform the govern and the presid these leader sharpli reduc the play field in gener judg from the elect battl the impress wa creat that travkin s parti is not go to parliament to work but to fight unmask and brand peopl if thi tone is assum by the communist as well noth good await our parliament we will simpli get anoth copi of the suprem soviet and further heighten of the confront in societi and what about zhirinovskiy s parti i shall allow myself to make the suggest that vladimir volfovich ha kept all hi ultranationalist slogan that shock russia and the world in reserv and will not use them in parliament he will save them for better time hope to gain all the power he will quit probabl regard the next two year as a campaign stretch over the time until the 1996 presidenti elect he will tri to creat for himself the imag of the pike that live in the lake to keep the small fish alert from hi standpoint it is a win win situat if thing get better in the economi he will take credit for it he will say look my parti came to offic and thing were straighten out if it becom harder to live again he ha a readi explan you did not allow me to creat a govern and thi is what you get although in hi heart i think that the last thing zhirinovskiy would like would be to end up in govern becaus then he would have to be respons for everyth he promis incident he is not be offer a posit in the govern of cours that would be too much of a price to pay to see how a soap bubbl fill with empti promis might burst anoth scenario look surpris but it is worth mention the ldpr could end up as the least stabl parliamentari format dure the elect campaign zhirinovskiy made one tactic error in respons to the question of how the deputi of hi parti would vote in the duma he said the way their leader tell them to as long as vladimir volfovich wa play the role of a steamship and pull sever dozen complet unknown politician into parliament he wa forgiven everyth but now look at the list of deputi of the ldpr you would think that they would not be will to play the role of extra while their leader is buck for presid a split in the parti ha alreadi been note zhirinovskiy s former close alli and hi candid for vice presid a zavidiy announc that he wa go to break with the boss stop financ him and lead hi peopl away from him so the ldpr faction and it includ about 70 peopl with variou vote could have the most unexpect version of form a bloc and so the new parliament will begin it work in a coupl of day what are our hope and concern in thi connect we have but one hope and it is that from the first day all the polit forc will reject confront and polit accus against one anoth and will understand that thi path ha alreadi been follow to the end and ha led to noth but troubl it ha led to bloodsh our hope is that the deputi have come to the duma to work and that mean abov all not to seek that which separ them but place where they come togeth decis that are mutual accept even if they involv concess if they approach thing reason they must understand that there simpli is no other path with the current align of forc not onli no singl faction but not even ani conceiv combin of them can produc a major and thi mean that with ani other approach the parliament might not be abl to decid anyth at all and we are alarm by the still remain possibl albeit theoret of reject the cours of reform with a subsequ collaps of the entir economi parliament could adopt some antireform law but it would be extrem difficult to do so in the first place ani draft law that in one way or anoth affect expenditur from the feder budget may be submit onli with a recommend from the govern so ani populist resolut to increas expenditur without actual cover them will be practic imposs to pass in the second place ani law adopt by the duma will have to be monitor by the council of the feder whose disapprov will have to be overcom not by a simpl major of duma vote but by two third in the third place the presid who even after the elect confirm the unchang cours of the reform still ha the right to a veto which also can be overridden onli by two third and propon of reform and those who support them do have a third of the vote in the duma true further advanc of the reform will requir new law that work in their direct which the deputi are quit capabl of block propon of reform have onli one way of prevent thi work constantli with the deputi especi the centrist part of them convinc them that they are right and with all the difficulti of the situat show unwav concern for the social direct of the reform it is assum that the feder assembl will begin it work with a joint session of the two chamber at which they will hear the messag from the presid then they will have to adopt their regul a draft of which ha been drawn up by the commiss on legisl propos and elect speaker and their deputi we are no longer threaten by the return of a chief of all deputi like khasbulatov there will simpli be no such posit each chamber will have it own chairman whose role will be to conduct the meet and take charg of the daili routin and he will have no power over the parliamentari committe the speaker of the duma hi two deputi all three from differ faction and deleg from the faction and group with vote power in proport to their number will make up a confer for pure organiz busi determin the agenda conven extra session send draft law to committe etc the confer will make none of the decis the presidium of the suprem soviet essenti allow itself the question of the speaker of the duma ha alreadi been hotli discuss in the press even in spite of thi figur s obviou weak as compar to the recent past there are mani in the run each faction would like to see it own repres mani well known politician would be will to occupi thi posit even if the speaker ha basic repres function they allow him to be constantli in view which is of no small import for politician who are work out far reach plan at variou time interest in thi post ha been express by s shakhray and v zhirinovskiy v lukin would not reject it and russia s choic would not be against recommend s kovalev it will not be possibl of cours to decid on a mutual accept candidaci at the session itself thi will be done through preliminari consult which are proceed with difficulti so far it seem that none of the influenti faction will achiev success it will be necessari to agre on some neutral figur who ha not plainli announc hi polit sympathi we will not guess there is not long left to wait now the main thing is to get readi for product work so that parliamentar in russia will final acquir featur that are attract to societi and will actual becom a real mean of creat a new russia
