percent everi 5 year in 1991 we reach the mark at which the coeffici of natur growth wa onli 0 7 per thousand resid and begin in 1992 the popul actual began to decreas the number of death exceed the number of birth by 204 000 peopl thi year thi process ha acceler a trud correspond ask professor yu komarov doctor of medic scienc correspond member of the academi of technolog scienc and gener director of the medsotsekonominform scientif product associ to comment on so lament a fact komarov in and of itself zero popul growth or even a decreas in popul is a widespread phenomenon in the world howev russia s situat is uniqu in that the transit to a natur decreas is caus chiefli by a decreas in the birth rate in the last 5 year 900 000 person were born in our countri or 36 percent less than in the preced 5 year and if we includ 1992 the number is 195 000 less the birth rate in russia ha becom the lowest among develop countri the second factor influenc the popul decreas is a sharp worsen of the health of peopl and growth of mortal thi rais the problem of the health and life span of the popul to the rank of nation problem determin the surviv and prospect of the nation the declin in birth rate and health is a consequ of the socioeconom and ecolog crisi the low level of financ of public health insuffici flexibl of it structur and the absenc of ani strategi in thi direct kozlov it ha usual been believ that asset invest directli into the develop of public health produc the greatest impact in improv the peopl s health but today the princip caus of morbid and mortal are associ with live condit and way of life komarov that would be the most correct approach to take to thi problem the qualiti of life of russian may be portray in gener form as follow in 1985 we were 68th in the world in gross product per capita and 77th in level of person consumpt thi wa respect 39 9 and 25 8 percent of the level in the usa in the past year the standard of live of russian drop further by a factor of two consum price increas by 26 time in 1992 while averag wage increas by onli 13 time and the rate of growth of pension and assist wa a third behind the growth of wage thi year these indic are even more deplor a drop in real incom ha result in a worsen of the consumpt structur the proport of food expens in the famili budget grew by an averag of 60 percent 85 among the poorest and pension in thi case consumpt of meat oil veget and fruit decreas by a time and a half on the other hand consumpt of potato and grain product of lesser valu in dietari respect increas henc the protein shortag in the russian diet wa 25 percent the vitamin c shortag wa 50 percent and the group b and a vitamin shortag wa 20 30 percent paradox as it may seem peopl in countri in which the qualiti of protect against avitaminosi gulp down vitamin supplement in our countri where the diet lack in nutrit respect the situat is revers the vitamin we produc of such low volum not to mention their qualiti that if we were to give them to all russian each person would receiv onli one multipl vitamin pill a year in the meantim in order to satisfi the countri s demand at the western level we would need to spend just 1 50 per russian on the develop of domest industri kozlov yuriy mikhaylovich what influenc is the ecolog situat in the countri have on our health komarov over 60 million russian live under condit in which the maximum permiss concentr of toxin in the air are continu exceed approxim half of our popul drink water that fail to satisfi hygien requir the work place of around 5 million person in industri and a million in construct and transport fail the safeti standard while 4 3 million work in condit under which the concentr of toxin in the air of the work zone exce the standard in order for the scale of ecolog contamin to becom more understand let me say that each year over 50 million ton of exhaust from enterpris and motor transport enter the air thi is 400 kilogram for everi russian and in citi like berezniki bratsk krasnoyarsk magnitogorsk novokuznetsk norilsk and perm a total of 84 citi morbid is 1 5 2 time higher than the countri averag kozlov your scientif product associ analyz the caus of worker mortal what diseas kill russian most often komarov it will seem strang but what took first place in 1991 wa suicid let me say right away that it is provok by social problem and stress a high percentag of loss also come from work relat injuri and among diseas circulatori ailment neoplasm and diseas of the respiratori and digest tract have the lead the structur of health impair is now determin chiefli by long last chronic diseas onc again there is a direct relationship to the state s strategi in health protect we need a two or three time increas in outlay on public health and an increas of sever time on improv of the environ and develop of the social infrastructur but the new power are as hesit to provid money for the health of peopl as were the former one thi is whi infecti diseas have begun spread in our countri onc again there are increasingli larger number of case of acut intestin infect salmonellosi and viral hepat mani hundr of thousand of case per year cholera which ha been forgotten by most develop countri is reveal itself more and more frequent tuberculosi is return women are a special problem in the last 3 year their morbid increas

nation product is alloc to public health in our countri no more than 3 4 percent is alloc each year more than 2 500 are spent per capita in the usa while in our countri 6 500 rubl were plan in 1993
