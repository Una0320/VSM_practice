when i welcom you mr mandela i want to put that question to you mandela thank you bishop your comment on that that katlehong incid mandela what happen today to the secretari gener of the anc and the chairman of the south african communist parti sacp must be condemn in the strongest term it show in a veri clear manner how the peopl in that area live i spoke to mr de klerk today the moment comrad

that is go to be veri interest bishop just to remind our viewer if you ve just tune in there s been a realli aw attack at katlehong earlier today one journalist wa kill sever were wound and it wa the occas when mr slovo and cyril ramaphosa and carl niehau and other were walk toward the area to inspect the area is that it mandela ye they went there to see for themselv how peopl in thi area are live in the light of the accus and counter accus that have been made and i think that the public now ha got an idea of what is hap there becaus the shoot start from the hostel without ani provoc bishop what about the argument i think that there is an argument that the anc had constantli said they don t want the polic around them when they go and visit the peopl is there anyth in that argument mandela there is no excus for the polic not do their duti of maintain law and order bishop they were told about the mandela interrupt whether we want the polic to be with us or not is irrelev the polic should not allow ani peopl to fire at innoc resid go about with their normal duti bishop i think they were in fact inform were they some of your peopl told me earlier text mandela on friday the region execut committe of the pwv pretoria witwatersrand vereenig area inform the polic even quit apart from that it wa well public that the secretari gener and the chairman of the south african communist parti were visit the area if the polic did not know that they were visit then they are not worth to be policemen bishop well of cours we have no polic here so we better not keep it one side i think could i just leav it for you at the moment you are go to see everybodi of cours soon about thi and leav thi incid and move on to the gener question of violenc in the countri mandela you re welcom bishop thank you what are we go to do mr mandela first of all can i suggest that all parti perhap should stop accus each other is it possibl to come to that kind of agreement mandela befor i answer your question i want to state veri clearli that whatev i m go to say my approach to problem my conduct and my statement are influenc by the object of build a new south africa of urg all leader of variou polit format to join in tri to build a new south africa i m interest in stabil both polit an econom so that we can attract invest in our countri becaus without those invest we are unabl to make the breakthrough which all of us desir i am therefor go to say that you can t avoid discuss the polici of other polit parti which are involv in the elect it happen all over the world and south africa is no except but the point is that whatev we say must be influenc by the idea of build a new south africa and unit our peopl bishop have you got anyth to give us tonight about stop the violenc i mean if you had the opportun to put it in a nutshel and fix it what would you do mandela well we are not the govern you must understand the task of maintain law and order is that of the govern not of the anc we have no state power we have no arm we have no caspir and violenc can onli be effect address by peopl who have these mean but within our capac we have tri to the best of our abil as an organ to support the effort which are made by a wide varieti of organ for peac we will continu to do so and that is whi we are talk to all polit parti those insid the negoti process and those who stand outsid becaus we want to avoid ani danger of a civil war in thi countri bishop well that s taken as is but it s also said by some of your critic that some of the sdu self defens unit some of those young men have run out of control you see in the headlin mafia group maverick young men sdu out of the control of the anc comment mandela the problem about the sdu onli occur within the last six month peopl have been die long befor that you must rememb that we are deal with a govern which ha a cultur of intoler freedom fighter have been die sinc the earli 60 there are no less than about 200 peopl who have die in polic custodi from the 60 and a statement which wa made by the late dr gluckman who had the opportun to deal with these case a number of other freedom fighter like neil argot and richard turner the goniw all these were kill long befor we had ani complaint about the sdu the complaint against the sdu is made primarili by the govern and the nation parti in order to divert attent from their own crimin neglig bishop but not entir haven t you come and said at least the anc came out and said and admit that some of those sdu are out of control mandela no you must put the matter in proper context we have had the courag and honesti to say to the public that we have problem with sdu but you must understand that the sdu are a commun base organ to protect the mass of the peopl after the govern ha fail to do it duti and after the peopl have lost their belong they have come out in order to provid some measur of protect to the commun bishop i think that s gener known but it s been suggest that now you should instruct if that s the word some of your veri senior men perhap in umkhonto we sizw spear of the nation anc militari wing who have high profil to go in there and sort it out mandela we have been there sort thing out last tuesday we had that 10 hour meet with the sdu in that area involv not onli the anc but the south african communist parti cosatu congress of south african trade union the mass democrat movement and i ask you what ha the govern done to address the question of violenc bishop befor we move away from thi violenc the heidelberg massacr the continu attack on civilian the ever rise crime rate again i ask what can we do text mandela we are against ani form of terror and what ha happen recent in connect with the tavern attack is a matter that is go to be discuss by the transit execut council tec we are against ani form of thuggeri and we have condemn it publicli in the strongest term bishop the tec now ha some muscl if i can use that paus i mean it is an establish organ and you ve been address the question of violenc i think we are talk about a nation peacekeep forc we are talk about an integr sap sadf south african polic south african defens forc umkhonto we sizw and other group how far off are we from that becaus it strike me mandela interrupt befor i deal with that let me just tell you about the report which wa made by the commission of polic from natal a report which ha been tabl befor the tec in that report he mention that befor the festiv season he drew the attent of the govern to the instabl in natal and felt that becaus the migrant were go back to natal thi might creat problem and aggrav the whole question of violenc he also got a legal opinion from senior council which show that the south african polic can go into natal and into the homeland without ani restrict they are free to do so bishop legal mandela legal and he also went further and identifi area where the ifp inkatha freedom parti and the kwazulu polic were respons for thi violenc and he mention that there wa a self defens unit in one area which wa alleg also to be involv in violenc but he wa honest and he said that there wa no concret evid to support thi alleg now that is a statement from a commission of polic in natal and you must therefor look at the whole question of the sdu from the point of view that we are face an extraordinari situat where the govern is work with crimin in order to destabil the peopl in that region bishop let s leav that now but stay in that region and ask you when are you and chief minist mangosuthu buthelezi go to fix thing up mandela well i have met chief buthelezi on three differ occas i have done everyth in my power to persuad him to come back and negoti with us but it is a fals premis to think that thi violenc can be address by two peopl meet in no govern in a countri anywher in the world will a govern refrain from take step to maintain law and order and reli on two individu you don t find that anywher it is the task of the govern to ensur that violenc is stop and that the slaughter of innoc peopl is immedi address by the govern and settl bishop do you still say that you will go ahead with the elect regardless of whether the freedom allianc is on board mandela we will persuad the freedom allianc to join in negoti and to take part in the elect bishop can you do that mandela i am discuss with the ultra right i have met gener viljoen dr ferdi hartzenberg mr dri bruwer and i am discuss the whole question of the violenc their demand for a separ volkstaat nation state and their particip in the elect i do so becaus it is absolut necessari for all section of our popul for all nation group to speak with one voic on the major nation issu face the countri bishop just seven minut left i have so much to ask you mr mandela let s talk about the possibl that your parti will probabl might whatev the express is win the elect let s make the presumpt that you do what kind of a south africa as far as the economi will we have you have done away with the idea of nation but we hear a lot of talk about redistribut of wealth a wealth tax and so forth so what can be expect in that area mandela we are not concern with label our primari object is to address the social econom problem face our peopl the question of unemploy which is 50 percent of the econom activ popul of the countri lack of hous lack of educ and medic facil and that is our object that must be done by ensur that the resourc of the countri are equal avail to all south african irrespect of color or creed and that is what we intend do bishop but that requir money doesn t it and some economist are say it requir free market style gener money no more talk of a marxist lenin command economi comment mandela we have never talk about a marxist economi as the african nation congress the peopl who say that we were onc commit to a marxist economi are either say so becaus of ignor or out of malic our concern is not to adopt ani pattern from ani other countri it is to address the real problem face our countri and these are the problem i have refer to we are alreadi as a polit organ far advanc in see organ like the intern monetari fund with whose presid i met in septemb thi year as heard we have met the world bank on sever occas to discuss the question of resourc to be abl to address thi problem i have met presid like mr bill clinton prime minist major presid mitterand and all of them i m discuss question among other of resourc so that we can address the problem i have refer to bishop what are the assur you are give these top peopl about the economi are you say don t worri invest in profit out no problem mandela we are brief them on the step that we have taken to attract invest i have point out to them that in may 1992 we issu an invest guid in which we guarante all investor against the confisc of their properti secondli that they will be entitl to repatri their profit and dividend and that if an investor sold hi busi activ in the countri he will be entitl to repatri them bishop sorri i ve got to rush everyth up so much to ask quickli the question of freedom of express and in particular the control of the sabc south african broadcast corpor it s been said in certain quarter that the anc now control the sabc that the nation parti control it befor now it s the anc doe it control the sabc mandela i don t think so thi is a board that wa set up by an independ select panel compos of south african of the highest integr they are not member of the anc and they could not set up a board which is compos of member of the anc bishop but they are point to three promin and highli profession peopl who are close connect to the anc and who ve just join the sabc comment mandela well i think that as far as i m awar if you are talk about the three person that i know they have been select becaus of their merit not becaus of associ with ani polit organ bishop to cut it short you wouldn t chang thought let s say you were the leader of the countri in three or four month you wouldn t lift the phone and tell news editor and other peopl what to do mandela the democrat cultur is veri much entrench in the african nation congress we believ in an independ media becaus we would like to look at the media as a mirror to see how we are function and to control the media would be contrari to the fundament principl of democraci and it is for that that we have attack the nation parti s control of the sabc bishop move to anoth matter veri quickli in the time left the afrikan what is wrong if a group of afrikan sincer want to move away and live on their own mandela we are against ethnic solut bishop whi mandela we have fought the bantustan system and we have now overthrown that system even the nationalist govern which wa the onli govern which recogn the bantustan ha now agre and a claus ha been entrench in our constitut that all the bantustan all the homeland self govern and independ must now be reincorpor into south africa if we made an except and gave in to the demand of the afrikan for a volkstaat nation state we would be reopen the same thing all the bantustan would put forward similar claim and you will break up south africa into a number of differ polit entiti which would destroy our economi bishop just a few second left what kind of messag would you send now at thi point in our histori mandela we would like the spirit of reconcili to be accept by all south african bishop not reveng mandela no we have made the point veri clearli that we are not here for retribut we are here to tri and contribut to the build of a new south africa bishop mr mandela thank you veri much inde for come along need i say that wa nelson mandela of the africa nation congress thank for join us and stay with us good night mandela good night
