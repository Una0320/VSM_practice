he is in damascu to support the accord he doe not want to do that befor hi own plan come to fruition with him hold power instead of saddam husayn but if the negoti on the syrian track stumbl or drag on too long for the unit state then channel of communict between al hakim and the u s administr will requir him to declar a posit on the gaza jericho accord if he condemn it he will burn the bridg to
