develop of the legal base of environment protect and econom assess of natur resourc the develop of product scientif and engin progress and expans of human industri activ must not destroy the harmoni that ha been establish in natur or destroy natur resourc there are no wast in natur all biolog chemic and physic process occur in a close circl all industri enterpris affect the environ to some degre or other research ha shown that at least one third of all process raw materi is now transform into finish product consequ the remain fraction of raw materi becom wast that are often harm to the environ in the past decad the volum of industri wast releas into the atmospher in conjunct with the rapid increas in industri develop ha increas sharpli and continu to increas each year industri enterpris thermal electr power plant motor vehicl blast furnac aircraft engin and other machin releas hundr of million of ton of carbon in the form of oxid primarili carbon dioxid into the atmospher the carbon dioxid releas by human and the anim world is absorb by plant life to provid a stabl state of equilibrium in the atmospher unfortun thi equilibrium ha now been upset and the alarm of ecolog catastroph is sound louder with each pass year the continu increas in the concentr of carbon dioxid in the atmospher is an especi neg phenomenon carbon dioxid is known to be toxic in larg quantiti it caus hypoxia and debilit respir and cardiac activ an increas in carbon dioxid concentr not onli ha a direct effect on organ but also facilit an increas in absorpt of the earth s thermal radiat by the atmospher which in turn result in climat warm throughout the entir planet as is known in the past 100 year the averag temperatur of the earth s surfac increas by 0 5 0 6 which ha in turn acceler glacial thaw and increas the sea s level by 1 5 2 m also releas along with carbon dioxid dure the combust process is carbon monoxid which ha an even more toxic effect and which may result in debilit of mani vital function includ ill of the central nervou system metallurgi plant and thermal power plant releas a larg amount of sulfur dioxid fossil fuel also contain a great deal of sulfur each year about 30 million ton of sulfur ga are releas in our countri when sulfur dioxid react with atmospher moistur sulfur and sulfur acid form when nitrogen contain coal and oil are burn oxid are form that combin with atmospher moistur to yield nitrou and nitric acid these acid may caus seriou lung diseas ecolog and sanitari and hygien estim are formul on the basi of data about emiss of pollut into the atmospher in natur everyth is interconnect toxic impur that end up in the air are return to the earth in the form of precipit fall on pastur meadow field garden and veget garden pollut precipit also fall into water reservoir the acid contain in precipit react with metal aluminum cadmium mercuri lead etc in the soil and they infect the water and thu the fish precipit is not the onli sourc of water pollut industri transport and household wast are dump into water reservoir in quantiti such that mani river and lake can no longer be clean with exist resourc the natur puriti of rel shallow ground water ha been lost phosphat from wast the nitrat that are use everywher as fertil and other toxic materi have infiltr them the situat regard irrig water is no better it chemic composit larg dictat the qualiti of agricultur project in which the content of nitrat phosphat and metal ha also risen countri with a high technolog disciplin permit the use of rel small amount of fertil in countri with a lower technolog disciplin the level is higher owe to an attempt to increas crop yield as a rule thi result in a declin in product qualiti and so the circl ha close peopl harm the environ the environ shorten their life the child mortal rate in mani countri ha stop decreas and in sever countri it ha even begun to increas studi conduct by the world health organ gave the sad result an elev lead content wa discov in the blood of 30 percent of neonat where is the way out reason suggest that as soon as possibl further destruct of natur must be halt it must be restor on a planetwid scale and popul control must be begun so as not to extend beyond the scope of the biospher s object capabl understand of the fact that peopl s live truli depend on their effect on natur ha not yet becom widespread it must be acknowledg that more than a few measur to regul man s relationship with natur have been develop in the develop countri where the economi is subject to market relationship energi save technolog are be develop intens thi is make it possibl to burn less fuel and consequ reduc the releas of carbon into the atmospher the manufactur of lead free gasolin ha begun and exhaust gase have begun to contain far less toxic impur today the search for way of solv ecolog problem is be conduct at the intern state and sector level mani countri regularli exchang inform about the current condit of the environ and are creat a common ecolog data bank unfortun our countri ha not yet becom suffici activ engag in thi process and the situat in our countri cannot be call good accord to exist data about 30 million of our citizen are live in ecolog disast area life itself is compel us to consid the problem of restor and protect natur as prioriti problem qualiti sewag treatment is not provid in 600 citi more than two third of toxic sourc do not meet the requir specifi in standard volum of unutiliz toxic industri wast are increas and a larg portion of them are transport to household wast dump or els to disorgan storag site which eventu result in toxic materi end up in underground water and water reservoir and in infect of the plant and anim world unfortun the aviat industri whose technic polici ha long fail to recogn ecolog as a prioriti directli is a definit contributor to these neg consequ of econom activ each year about 290 000 ton of toxic materi in the form of gase releas from stationari sourc are form throughout the sector as a whole from them dust and ga scrub unit trap 136 500 ton of toxic materi 47 1 percent and 153 700 tonn i e about 0 25 percent of the total volum of wast throughout the countri are releas into the atmospher consid the fact that the sector s enterpris are locat in citi with an industri develop potenti where tough standard are in effect and also as a rule in dens popul complex of apart build the neg effect of the sector s product on the environ is not alway adequ reflect by the volum of emiss of toxic materi in the total mass of emiss the greatest volum percentag of pollut come from boiler and other thermal power plant 36 40 percent foundri work 15 18 percent paint 14 15 percent and engin ground test 14 15 percent the sector s product is character by a long list of wast and although solid particl and hydrocarbon predomin in the composit of toxic materi gener they account for 74 6 and 13 percent respect individu enterpris releas up to 70 differ toxic element and compound into the air medium each year about 3 800 000 ton of ash slag spend mold and core mixtur sediment in clean equip and other wast are gener at the sector s enterpris of that amount 800 000 ton is toxic hundr of thousand of ton of abras dust contain cobalt niobium molybdenum tungsten chromium nickel vanadium and other metal that are need for industri but are nevertheless harm to the environ are releas each year accord to data from a 1992 inventori of sector enterpris throughout moscow the total volum of toxic wast gener consist of the

of the atmospher and water reservoir improv the sanitari and hygien condit of labor elimin pollut of the atmospher by paint materi compon and reduc pollut of water sourc by petroleum product the develop of scienc intens process and equip and their introduct into industri are still far from adequ one of the main distinguish featur of scienc intens technolog and product is the fact that they requir littl raw materi and energi i e they are more resourc save therefor the wast gener when they are use are not great water consumpt in these process is also much lower than in convent industri process which ultim reduc the amount of contamin sewag membran ultrasound laser plasma high speed machin and progress cast are among those resourc save low wast and scienc intens process that are especi signific for the sector s product on an ecolog plane the sector s lack of a system approach to solv these problem is anoth veri import reason whi the work that is be done with respect to ecolog improv of industri and creation of new type of resourc save low wast process ha not been effect enough accord to the standard intern classif system the aviat sector is among the 10 most scienc intens sector it is understood that the task of switch the industri over to scienc intens low wast process in the present period under the condit of the system of econom relationship that have develop in the sector where the busi agreement with enterpris ha by and larg becom the main sourc of financ r amp d is rather difficult one of the main prioriti task relat to organ a system approach is that of develop a special integr environment protect program the foundat of thi program consist of measur gear toward ecolog improv of the sector s exist product and creation of new resourc save low wast process with mandatori expert examin in all stage of develop introduct and dissemin for the purpos of clarifi their ecolog feasibl the technolog measur plan by the sector should be base on prioriti
