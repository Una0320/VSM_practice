vladimir pasechnik wa born in 1937 in stalingrad a citi soon to be ravag by the second world war he becam one of the brightest young scientist in the soviet union determin to use hi talent in the caus of peac never allow hi research in biophys to play ani part in the kind of destruct that had cost the live of hi famili after graduat he did research at the institut of high molecular compound in leningrad work on new antibiot and treatment for supposedli incur ill such as cancer in 1974 he wa approach by a gener from the soviet ministri of defenc with an irresist offer to set up and run a laboratori in leningrad with an unlimit budget to buy equip in the west and recruit the best staff from all over the soviet union it would be known as the institut of ultra pure biochem prepar for pasechnik it wa an opportun to realis mani of hi most cherish ambit in the fight against ill hi earli research wa promis he felt he could produc a cure to some form of cancer until then he had thought he would never have the resourc to complet hi work now he wa be given the chanc to develop one of the soviet union s most advanc laboratori in biotechnolog he accept the fact that the offer came from the ministri of defenc did not worri him unduli in the soviet union the militari wa the engin of most scientif research it had the cash and the peopl to run it even if a scientif project had a strictli civilian applic the militari wa still in charg it wa the soviet way from 1974 to 1981 pasechnik built up hi special laboratori scour the countri until he had 400 peopl on hi staff a lavish budget and enough hard currenc to give hi scientist constant access to the latest biotechnolog advanc in the west the laboratori began it work in 1981 over the next two year pasechnik realis the truth far from be the heart of a new civilian research oper he wa at the centr of a vast network of factori and laboratori work on deadli new weapon of war offici we were involv in vaccin develop and in produc prepar for protect crop said pasechnik in fact we were develop method of product and equip for a huge biolog warfar programm to begin with pasechnik had littl idea of the scale of the oper onli later did he discov that as well as hi laboratori in leningrad there were two more in moscow two just outsid it and one in novosibirsk all work on the same project five manufactur plant employ 15 000 peopl were oper in other part of the countri the oper known as biopreparat had a budget of 200m roubl and ten of million of american dollar a year it wa one of the best kept secret of the cold war it task wa to develop new strain of diseas more power than anyth known to scienc and to produc them in aerosol form the germ also had to be resist to antibiot avail to the nato armi of the west the specif job alloc to pasechnik s laboratori staff wa to make them effect weapon of war they had to find way of deliv the germ by artilleri shell bomb or missil to ensur that they had a long life in the open air and that they could be dispers over a wide area the breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institut of appli microbiolog at obolensk 60 mile south of moscow there with the help of work done at pasechnik s laboratori scientist develop their first super plagu a new strain of tularaemia a sever infecti bacteri diseas of man and domest anim carri by contact or insect bite it is name after tular california where it wa discov the test on it were suffici encourag for moscow to give permiss for full scale develop and product two year later the scientist at obolensk were ask to develop an even more deadli germ base on pneumon plagu anoth airborn infect pasechnik s job wa to refin the product process to make the oper more effici as a result by 1987 the soviet union had suffici industri capac to manufactur 200 kilo of the super plagu everi week enough to kill up to 500 000 peopl the super plagu germ wa of cours never manufactur on thi scale the germ had a short life and onli enough wa made for test but the biopreparat network stood on standbi readi to begin fullscal product when instruct at a time in the futur that wa design day x here then wa a programm for produc the most devast genet engin weapon ever seen just wait to be given the go ahead tini quantiti of the russian super plagu could devast ani citi in the west kill million while leav build factori and raw materi intact they would be the perfect design weapon at the soviet defenc ministri high rank gener were fulli awar of thi biolog capabl and built it into their militari plan known as the weapon of special design they would be use not onli as a last resort but as support weapon in a convent non nuclear conflict to attack the enemi s troop reserv and hamper hi oper at port and rail centr everi part of thi programm wa in breach of the 1972 biolog and toxin warfar convent an intern agreement which the soviet union had sign it wa also against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been proclaim by mikhail gorbachev for pasechnik the gorbachev era wa a chanc to tri to chang the direct of the programm at hi laboratori in late 1985 he pressur senior offici in biopreparat to let him switch some of hi research effort to the civilian purpos for which it had ostens been establish he got nowher i wa told mani time just to get on with my work and stay in my place he said pasechnik did just that by 1988 he had risen to a rank equival to that of major gener and wa in charg of two manufactur plant and three research laboratori two of these were work on biolog weapon the third wa given to him to placat hi desir to do civil work and also as a cover for the biolog warfar research but pasechnik wa increasingli uneasi he had no idea that hi work wa in breach of the 1972 treati he did not know such a treati exist but he felt that the weapon he wa help to develop were an abus of hi scientif skill and demonstr hypocrisi in the russian militari command about the gorbachev revolut abov all he felt passion that genet engin biolog weapon were a crime against human in late 1988 he began to think about defect despit hi long and illustri scientif career pasechnik had never been allow to travel outsid the soviet bloc then in the summer of 1989 biopreparat began negoti with a factori in toulous franc which manufactur equip for chemic laboratori pasechnik volunt to go to finalis the deal as a reward for hi overal perform permiss wa grant he arriv in franc at the begin of octob he had thought care about how to escap the kgb watcher who travel with hi group one morn he telephon the british embassi in pari and in a brief convers with a surpris diplomat announc himself hi posit and hi wish to defect the news of hi offer reach the secret intellig servic si otherwis known as mi6 in london at a critic time for the previou five year si the american cia and a number of nato militari intellig organis had been tri to piec togeth the snippet of inform they had about the soviet biolog warfar programm in may 1979 american intellig had heard report of an explos at a secret soviet research facil on the outskirt of sverdlovsk 850 mile east of moscow a leak of anthrax had kill up to a hundr peopl an area three mile downwind of the factori had been contamin the russian had tri to contain the damag with a widespread immunis programm but it had prove larg useless throughout the 1980 the leak had been rais by both british and american offici with their soviet counterpart but the offici line remain the same that a hand of peopl had die in the citi after eat contamin meat bought on the black market there wa no biolog weapon programm snippet of inform from sourc in the soviet union suggest otherwis satellit pictur show plant and test site appar configur for the manufactur of biolog weapon the dia the defenc intellig agenc the pentagon s spi estim that the russian had up to eight site for develop and store biolog weapon si larg concur with that view and a seri of report were circul to intellig chief and british minist warn that the soviet biolog programm had not slow down as a result of the gorbachev reform as frequent happen when intellig is fragmentari the politician refus to hear the messag at the time all western govern had been seduc by gorbachev s reform the cold war wa thaw and no prime minist or presid wa prepar to risk a confront with the soviet union that might chang the delic balanc of intern relat at the same time there wa a sens that gorbachev wa an honour man who would not allow anyth as terribl as biolog weapon to be develop while he wa presid the intellig warn were ignor when the si station chief in pari flash the messag to london about the would be defector in toulous it caus consider excit at last here wa proof that would satisfi even the most sceptic politician pasechnik wa driven to pari and caught a british airway flight to heathrow travel on fals paper suppli by british intellig as hi feet touch british soil pasechnik burst into tear the decis to leav hi countri and hi famili had place a terribl strain on the defector he had convinc himself that the work he had been do wa so terribl that he would probabl face seriou charg and perhap prison in the west it is a measur of hi courag that despit hi fear he step off the plane readi to tell all as soon as he wa settl in a safe hous outsid london he wa reassur that he had found a new home and not a prison cell there wa the normal nervous in si about ani defector wa he a plant all the indic were that he wa bona fide he did not know how to drive a clear sign that he wa a member of the privileg elit in the soviet union the distress he show when he recount the work he wa do wa imposs to fake then there wa hi love of mozart sonata which he would listen to in the even after yet anoth dinner with hi guardian the si debrief were quickli reassur he brought with him a wealth of new inform it wa stun said one of the debrief a whole ministri expos billion of roubl spent a complet organis shown to be a front then there wa the clear involv of gorbachev thi friend of the west it just went on and on to cope with all the inform pasechnik produc si the ministri of defenc and other govern depart set up a special task forc of scientist intellig offic and analyst to assess the intellig and put it into a wider context it wa painstak work but veri fruit as he describ hi entir life educ and work the taskforc understood for the first time the real relationship between the academi of scienc previous consid a pure civilian bodi and the soviet militari as is usual in such case the intellig glean from pasechnik wa share with the cia on both side of the atlant the mosaic of russia s biolog weapon programm wa gradual fill in as the pictur clear so both the cia and si began to brief their respect polit master for the first time the politician were given unambigu report clearli prepar on the basi of inform from a highli place defector to underlin the serious of the problem pasechnik wa brought out to brief senior offici on both side of the atlant the evid wa so compel that even the politician who had no wish to confront gorbachev were left with no choic in april 1990 the british and american govern jointli confront the soviet union with the evid and spell out in detail what they knew there wa no reaction then in june 1990 presid georg bush and margaret thatcher met separ with gorbachev both rais the question of biolog weapon gorbachev deni all knowledg thatcher who believ she had a special close relationship with the soviet leader told him that unless the programm wa stop the west would go public gorbachev promis that he would look into the matter two month later the soviet foreign minist eduard shevardnadz sent a formal repli rebut the charg by thi time both the cia and si had produc an even more exhaust brief for bush and thatcher have succeed in forc action at the highest level after so mani year of frustrat the intellig commun wa determin to press it case until the russian confess in decemb 1990 the russian issu an invit to washington and london to visit four of the site that had been name a joint anglo american deleg wa dispatch if the trip wa intend to be reassur it had the opposit effect in obolensk the british discov a chamber for test biolog weapon suspend in an aerosol the steel room which wa 50ft squar had post on the floor to which anim could be tie while vent in the ceil allow poison to be spray into the room the team also discov a chamber use to test deliveri system for biolog weapon at anoth site there wa row after row of ferment use to mass produc hundr of kilo of biolog weapon a chill confirm of everyth pasechnik had reveal nevertheless the russian continu their denial in septemb 1991 a month after the attempt coup john major the new british prime minist met gorbachev in the kremlin publicli the two hour meet wa confin to econom issu but major confront him with the evid of the secret weapon programm again gorbachev deni everyth and move the normal unflapp major to wave an angri finger in the face of the russian leader we ve got the good on you he shout as the intellig commun continu ad to the file the confront with moscow continu through the fall of gorbachev and the rise to power of bori yeltsin on februari 1 1992 bush and yeltsin met for their first summit in advanc of the meet at camp david american diplomat made clear that the biolog weapon programm wa a major stumbl block between the two alli and a gestur by yeltsin in thi area would be seen as a sign of a new era in u s russian relat thi time yeltsin came prepar he admit for the first time that there had inde been a secret programm and that he had order it to be shut down but it wa not for anoth month that yeltsin wa told by hi own offici of the full extent of the programm in march the russian militari final came clean they had secretli develop bomb and missil capabl of carri the super plagu in defianc of intern agreement yeltsin sign a formal decre cancel the programm but the disinform did not stop there as promin russian offici involv in the biopreparat programm set about tri to minimis the work they had been involv in it wa a campaign fill with the kind of lie and evas that were suppos to have vanish in the new era of democraci in russia for exampl gener valentin yevstigneyev assur the newspap nezavisimaya gazeta there were not as mani peopl involv as it might seem he maintain that the work of the variou laboratori wa essenti for civilian purpos he also tri to diminish the role of pasechnik reaction like these contribut to grow sceptic in both london and washington that yeltsin s order to dismantl the biopreparat project wa be carri out although the main test site wa report to have been shut down those monitor the project were hardli reassur when it wa announc that the man put in charg of the dismantl of biopreparat would be gener anatoliy kuntsevich the architect of the soviet union s chemic weapon programm hi appoint wa seen as a sop to the hardlin in the militari one senior western intellig offici said here wa thi man who had done noth but lie to us for year on chemic weapon and now suddenli we are suppos to accept that he is willingli go to set about destroy hi life s work we could hardli be expect to take yeltsin s promis at face valu in juli 1992 the british and american govern demand from the russian a list of all their biolog weapon research product and storag site and access to them two month later russia agre to allow a full inspect but fail to admit the exist of all of their site there the matter stand sinc then verif ha prove almost imposs to reinforc western concern the cia brought out a defector from the biopreparat programm in late 1992 he confirm pasechnik s stori and ad to western suspicion that while yeltsin wa claim the programm had stop the research and develop of new strain of genet engin superweapon were continu apac when presid bill clinton and yeltsin met in vancouv less than a year ago biolog warfar wa on the agenda onc again yeltsin assur the american presid that all work had stop thi time yeltsin wa so convinc that even some of the most cynic in the intellig commun were inclin to believ him then last autumn anoth defector from the biopreparat project came over to british intellig to tell hi debrief what step the russian militari had taken to keep the project go in everi facil that had been open for inspect to western intellig the russian had establish convinc cover stori that made it appear as if each site had been convert to research or manufactur of vaccin the secret work continu in part of the site that were never visit by the american or british offici at the same time a secret new facil wa be built at lakhta near st petersburg far from the biopreparat biolog warfar programm be shut down it had undergon consider modernis work is continu as befor in defianc of yeltsin s order if the stori so far ha not had a happi end for britain and america the sourc of the inform that expos the programm ha been more fortunad today vladimir pasechnik is happili settl in england he ha a job he love work for a british compani do exactli the civilian research he want to do when he graduat for him the disappoint is that hi sacrific in leav the countri he still talk about with a patriot fond ha not stop the programm he still consid to be a seriou threat to human if thi research is allow to continu in defianc of the polit leadership in moscow it make a mockeri of russia s pretens to be a democraci it also rais seriou question about the futur intent of the russian militari who have use polit capit and scarc resourc to continu a programm that remain a key part of their war plan
