sigh of relief at the breakthrough that wa made through thi agreement i do not think we should look at the matter from the point of view of winner and loser polit comment will talk about strategi fail strategi and bad strategi the import thing is that south africa now is face with an elect which is realli inclus it ha been achiev in injuri time but still a tri score in injuri time is a tri bishop i

are you go to do it van der ross well with a lot of elbow greas of cours the whole logist of be abl to provid at thi veri late stage for an effect accommod of a new player is truli go to be veri problemat and veri difficult but we have mobil immedi a sort of an a team into the field they are alreadi in kwazulu work with our local team there we ve got a back up team back in the head offic work right at thi moment on develop strategi for all the differ element of the elect on the basi of the work we have done today alreadi it doe look as if it s possibl to put it togeth bishop now stick physic ifp at the bottom of the form that will probabl rais some legal question there van der ross no the act and the regul will be chang to accommod all of the necessari there are a number of issu that will need to be chang but obvious with the cooper of all the parti thi is go to be possibl bishop mr maharaj the amend that have to be made now what do they look like maharaj the amend are be draft sinc thi afternoon they will be put to the negoti council tomorrow the amend to the constitut are fairli straight forward they simpli are an amend to two claus one a constitut principl and the other one is section 160 which provid that in the case of provinci constitut and specif in the case of kwazulu natal there shall be provis for the zulu monarch bishop dr nguban now what ha happen what is the situat with king zwelithini and the zulu nation and how are you read that nguban well the king wa worri when it becam clear that a feder dispens will not be achiev in thi countri so self determin for hi peopl for hi kingdom wa go to be total wipe off the polit process so he demand that the sovereignti of the zulu kingdom should be restor and the kingdom itself recogn we work hard at negoti thi posit and now it is go to be enshrin both in the nation constitut and it will be made mandatori for the provinci constitut of kwazulu natal to enshrin that as well bishop nevertheless it remain as part of the greater whole doesn t it nguban certainli it s part of a greater south africa but allow for the differ commun to achiev what we can call a fair measur of self determin bishop what do you say mr maharaj maharaj i do not think that the provis speak in ani way about sovereignti what the provis say is that the constitut of natal shall provid a place for the zulu monarch that will be left to the legislatur and it will be left to the mediat process to resolv precis in what form and to what extent the matter is dealt with but i think that nonetheless it is import that the provis ha led to similar space be made in other provinc where there may be a monarch bishop now back to you dr nguban now the zulu support the support inde not just zulu of the ifp are they go to get the messag quickli that you are on board now nguban well we ve been veri much prime for elect all along we have an elect campaign which ha been work incessantli we never oppos elect as a matter of just oppos it we want to have a dispens that we could live with that could have mean to the live of our peopl and that ha been achiev and we are readi to go bishop but when you say readi to go i mean onli a week ago you were say no go and i suppos that messag got through all over the place where there are ifp support now you will have to say go go go nguban well our peopl are highli motiv highli politic and they will respond accordingli maharaj i do think that the public have been face with confus signal come from the inkatha freedom parti and perhap i would ascrib that to poor tactic and strategi becaus it is veri import that while politician are seen to be peopl who make glib promis it is veri import as peopl who have fought for freedom that our promis should be real and should be consist and i believ that that s a crucial element in win voter support bishop dr nguban would you comment there nguban well i mean mac is skirt the whole ball game here he wa one of the peopl who made it imposs for us to be part of the process from the word go by the intransig that they adopt in the negoti process thank god that sens ha prevail at last so we have never promis anyth that wa not attain what we want wa a feder dispens for thi countri which the negoti process wa quit capabl of address but it wa stop from do so bishop alright let s move on now if we may to violenc the whole countri i suppos is scream out let s stop it stop it stop it what step are both parti the anc and the ifp take like realli to go and stop thi now nguban well the agreement state veri clearli that it is an agreement for reconcili and peac in south africa and all the signatori commit themselv pledg themselv to work for peac and free elect so it is go to have to be a truli combin effort no one parti can do it on it own bishop the mass action now inkatha youth are they go to march or not nguban well the caus for mass action is remov as far as we are concern bishop will the messag get through nguban well it is get through right now becaus there wa no mass action yesterday today and tomorrow so the messag is get through bishop anoth question for you at the moment dr nguban maharaj interrupt i think that on the question of violenc the countri ha certainli gone past the point where the threat of violenc to the elector process which wa perceiv at one time as a veri seriou and formid threat ha now been reduc in my estim by about 75 percent from what it wa two month ago the event which brought bophuthatswana fulli the peopl of bophuthatswana into the elector process the break up of the white right as well as the come in of the ifp have reduc that potenti for violenc immens and i believ that if we work at it with a will all parti we can certainli shortli after the elect through nation uniti establish peac in our countri bishop right one more for you befor i move on a littl bit dr nguban the imbizo meet gather of zulu call by hi majesti the king will it go ahead nguban well i don t know yet but hi majesti ha call the imbizo to mark a sad moment in our histori where we were be strip of our ident and our possess and so on now i don t know whether that precis condit still exist or not maharaj my understand of the matter is slightli differ we did consult hi majesti in the cours of the negoti and he indic that the press report were not within hi knowledg that he would be look into the matter and certainli he ha issu a statement now call upon hi subject to particip in the elect so i believ that now sinc it wa call accord to press report for the 26th 27th 28th that matter will no longer intrud on the elector process and the elect will go on bishop well let s stay with king zwelithini dr nguban what is hi statu now nguban well he is recogn as the constitut monarch in term of our present kwazulu constitut he ha a function in the legisl assembl he is the head of the whole indigen law system he is the head of the amakhosi chief and he occupi a posit of uniti in term of our nation bishop and the obviou next one chief buthelezi what s hi posit nguban well he is the tradit prime minist to the king but he is also the elect head of govern of kwazulu bishop there ha been a news rumor let s put it no more than that for the last coupl of week that chief buthelezi wa offer even a deputi presid a cabinet posit even if the ifp did not score well at the poll true or fals nguban no i have not heard of such an offer i think dr buthelezi is a democrat he will work hard to lead out parti to victori so that they will be no offer but he will get what is hi due in term of the constitut provis bishop mr maharaj maharaj certainli no such offer ha been made from our side what we have consist said is and in promot the idea of a govern of nation uniti is that on the basi of the elector result we will do everyth to accord all the parti a proper place in that govern we believ that the next five year central requir a trust of nation uniti we are come from a conflict ridden hate ridden societi and we have an immens job of reconstruct so we made no such offer except to say that each parti believ it is import ha immens elector support the elect will test that and on the basi of that test each will be accord a proper place in that govern of nation uniti bishop that mean what maharaj it mean if ani parti win five percent of seat in the nation assembl it qualifi for one seat in the cabinet and in proport to the higher percentag of number of seat it ha in the assembl it will get the requisit seat in the cabinet so that if a parti won 60 percent of the seat it will have 60 percent of the cabinet bishop mr van der ross i know you are not go to engag obvious in the polit discours but there are some more question for you veri quickli one concern the safeti of your monitor and their abil to get to place how confid are you that thi can happen i don t think in particular in natal kwazulu of cours van der ross well we are certainli look to the kwazulu author to provid both the messag and the cover for the climat for our peopl to be abl to move freeli through the territori if we are to set up machineri we need to within a veri short space of time a few day if we are to move in with massiv voter educ program which we are plan we can onli do that with complet cooper from the author but we are pretti certain that it is obvious in the interest of inkatha and through that possibl the kwazulu legisl assembl to give that kind of assist and i am sure we will get it bishop they will dr nguban they ll get thi support nguban they certainli will we ve alway pledg support for the iec bishop what s the situat about the state of emerg or partial state of emerg the nation peacekeep forc coupl of question there in one what s go to be the attitud now nguban we have not realli address that issu we do accept that it s anachronist to say you re go to have free and fair elect while you have a state of emerg we have state that posit but nevertheless we need to maintain the highest level of law and order and peac dure the elect process bishop there might be loos canon there outsid your control nguban that s what forc of law and order are there for that is a job realli for the secur forc bishop and the nation peacekeep forc is it go to be recogn as for what it ha been set up there to maintain peac as a nation forc nguban we ve had problem with the constitut of the nation peacekeep forc becaus it s taken in what i would call parti polit peopl and pretend to turn them into a nation peacekeep forc which will be abov prejudic and imparti we doubt that peopl who have been train as polit guerrilla forc can perform such a function maharaj let me say thi about the state of emerg it wa impos becaus of the violenc and the loss of life if that continu i believ that thi agreement will contribut substanti to reduc that violenc but the violenc is total unaccept yesterday the death of a lead photograph ken oosterbroek threw south africa into a shock ani more death are unaccept so the state of emerg ha been motiv by that need and at present while the agreement hold promis the realiti is that the violenc is ravag that provinc and we need to maintain it in such a way that free polit activ can take place activ bishop thank you veri much just a remind that of cours we ve been talk to mac maharaj dr ben nguban mr van der ross and we did approach the nation parti unfortun they ve have an extrem busi polit day and we could not get anybodi here at thi time that is the reason whi we don t see the nation parti sit with our other guest
