ecolog disast but even thi is suffici for evalu the word of the gentleman minist quot abov as be veri far from realiti neither i nor the ministri of environ and natur resourc have yet been defeat on a singl matter of principl the minist maintain how much self decept there is in thi claim is not that import in actual fact the ministri of environ and natur resourc ha not won on a singl major issu in the two year and six month of it exist the ministri ha not resolv one of the main problem of state administr in thi sphere a formula of the optimum combin of the need for feder regul of the use of natur resourc and supervis of wildlif manag with the right of compon of the feder to use their natur resourc ha not been found the public fund of the sector is such that the entir system of the ministri of environ and natur resourc is close to collaps the plunder of natur resourc is not diminish but increas the ministri of environ and natur resourc ha yet to devis all the necessari standard and rule ensu from the law on environment protect adopt more than two year ago the minist as chairman of the govern commiss held up for more than a year the develop of a system of measur ensu from the decis of the un confer on stabl develop which russia sign in rio de janeiro the ministri ha on dozen of occas in the past two year occupi the posit of detach observ at the time of the govern s adopt of decis danger for the ecolog state of the countri the principl of the separ of state administr of the use of natur resourc from state supervis of wildlif manag which ha been establish by law ha not been put into practic hunt and fish resourc for exampl are use and supervis by the same structur the ministri ha not organ the effici work of the feder ecolog fund the system of wildlif area which wa for a long time a model for other countri is fall apart on account of a lack of fund the interestingli conceiv environment safeti of russia program ha one foot in the grave the natur resourc bloc in the govern ha not succeed in realiz the idea if none of thi is not call a defeat what then is a defeat i shall dwell in more detail on the govern s decis on the develop of nuclear power engin of 28 decemb 1992 which the gentleman minist mention repeatedli i spoke at that session about the impermiss of a resumpt of the construct of nuclear electr power station for ecolog legal and econom reason the law doe not permit the adopt of such decis without the posit find of expert ecolog apprais thi wa confirm at that same session by justic minist nikolay fedorov today presid of chuvashia also all wa decid howev by the speech of the minist of environ who support howev monstrou the posit of the ministri of atom energi public anger at thi decis of the govern develop into an appeal to the constitut court which as we know took over thi case i emphas onc again at that session that i am not an oppon of nuclear energi in principl as the gentleman minist tri to portray me but i am for it environment safe develop in russia howev the develop of nuclear power engin accord to the propos plan entail unaccept environment risk it is indic incident that sever month later the state expert ecolog apprais in the absenc of the gentlemen minist it is true perhap the statu of politician as he call himself wa reflect here declin to approv the program of develop of the countri s nuclear power engin present by the ministri of atom energi and of cours our gentleman minist dissembl to put it mildli when he say that that ill fate decre made no provis for the fund of the ministri of atom energi it wa mere to unti the ministri of atom energi s hand in the fund of the sector that thi decis wa adopt i am forc to censur the gentleman minist at least for incompet for hi claim that that decre contain no specif project that expert could examin both in accord with the law and in accord with iaea rule the choic of site is the first part of construct to what expert ecolog apprais wa the decis on the choic of site for the far east kostroma and other nuclear power station of which the govern decre make mention put there ha long been the need for public discuss of all problem of the develop of power engin it first need to be decid how much energi we need and where and then we need to determin from which sourc to obtain thi energi meanwhil howev it would seem that we do not have a shortag but a surplu of energi and we should not be build up capac but learn from other countri how to consum half as much energi per unit of manufactur product i would add that the ministri of environ and natur resourc ha done littl as yet to attract attent in russia to the new progress sourc of energi steam and ga turbin the technolog of the combust of coal in a fluidiz bed and other yet there are calcul show that the replac of all nuclear power station unit not onli those be withdrawn owe to old age by environment accept energi sourc would be for russia sever time cheaper than bring the current nuclear power station up to safeti requir similar to their western counterpart now a littl about the minist as a politician thi i would recal is what he call himself it had becom clear at the start of 1992 that neither the ministri nor the govern nor the suprem soviet had the resourc for resolv the problem of environment protect a muster of all unit wa need and the first all russia ecolog and environment protect congress which could have adopt a program of russia s ecolog reviv wa seen as be such earlier such program had been adopt by the cpsu central committe and the council of minist but thi could no longer be done now by the compet structur alon without the most activ particip of industrialist scienc the bank and the public all were agre that such a congress need to be prepar as a matter of urgenc and the correspond action program which had been discuss at the ministri of environ and natur resourc collegium wa drawn up but the minist person revis the decis of the collegium and persuad a rutskoy to head the organ committe prepar the congress the latter agre provid it is said that he would not be burden with ani congress busi thi buri with full honor the whole idea of the congress the minist need not a congress but polit proxim to rutskoy and rutskoy need a congress even less so an ecolog congress did not take place in 1993 now the idea of the congress ha been taken up by the trade union movement i veri much hope that such a congress will be held for all that and will assist thi as best as i can and i would like to say thi further about polit the gentleman minist explain hi involv in the elect on the russia s choic platform by the fact that thi movement express interest in the develop of a strong ecolog program but where is it thi strong ecolog program and whi ha our govern up to now declin to develop and implement it for anyon with an interest in the parti and movement ecolog program it is obviou that the russia s choic ecolog program is far from the strongest it would seem that it wa not ecolog but some other polici which guid the minist in thi case as in the case with a rutskoy also not onli my attent i believ wa attract by the minist s attempt to justifi the combin of posit in the govern and in parliament by an analog with other countri in other countri the situat is fundament differ from our there the member of the parti which is the winner at the elect becom minist with us on the other hand minist occupi the seat of deputi and it is quit odd when a minist is elect by territori constitu how can he combin the duti of serv primarili the interest of hi constitu with hi feder oblig of not have favorit in the region i would recal that our minist attempt to get elect from nizhegorod oblast becaus perhap there are mani ministri of atom energi enterpris there and that onli after have fail there wa he includ in the extraterritori part of the russia s choic feder slate a progress economist who understand that a sound economi may exist onli with a sound ecolog wa propos for the posit of minist in novemb 1991 it is said that suvorov shaken by the scale of the embezzl of public fund maintain that ani suppli offic could after a year be execut without trial or investig it would seem that the minist of environ even if veri good at the time of hi appoint need to be remov after 18 month at the most a person is incap of resist for ani longer than thi the pressur of hi superior minist friend and foreign compani the gentleman minist s strike super optim whatev the subject the effici of the work of the ministri or of himself or the qualiti of the environ is help him evid justifi hi own inconsist and indecis in defens of the environ but for the state and societi and for us all thi polit posit of the minist is simpli danger p s as presidenti advis for the environ and health care in 1991 1993 i wa larg respons for the failur in the sphere of ecolog that have been describ as also for the self appoint of professor v i danilov danilyan as minist the statut on the secur council of russia interdepartment commiss for environment safeti recent approv by the presid record the commiss s decis are to be examin by the organ of state power if also i fail to achiev seriou result here i will have to move to nongovern structur in order to start all over again to organ public pressur on the person adopt ecolog danger decis
