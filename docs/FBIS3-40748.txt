she is fight against it excerpt from her convers with organis on the impact of the dunkel propos on the seed agricultur research and environ q in spite of stiff opposit to the dunkel propos central govern appear to have made up it mind to ratifi it your comment a thi govern is go neither with the support of the peopl nor with the convict that win the support of the peopl is it duti when govern think that they come into power onli with the help of multin compani and foreign agenc they assum that they will not be dismiss as long as they can keep the later happi at the same time they seem to forget that they are sovereign govern of an independ countri and not servant of the world bank imf or gatt in a democraci if a peopl make a govern they can also dismiss it when a govern start get monetari help from foreign countri to stay in power they stop give import to nation interest in india it start with the bofor case i can say with confid that multin compani world bank and imf have increas corrupt in our countri q do you think that the polici adopt by the central govern on the dunkel propos is in nation interest a no it is absolut an anti nation polici onli those polici are in nation interest which give prime import to our own peopl s interest q indian farmer love their seed as their children they would rather starv than destroy the seed in time of famin one wit peopl die of hunger but they would not consum their seed if the dunkel propos are accept what will be it impact on the indigen seed a accord to an advisor to the world bank a countri in which mani farmer live is backward but our countri too ha mani farmer becaus our cultur is connect with our soil we have a farm cultur which is base on forest cultur first of all the seed later our life thi view is fulli imbib by our farmer that is whi indian farmer love their seed as their children indian farmer know veri well that their freedom is connect with their seed the day their seed will be taken over by the multin compani they will becom slave when the new seed come into the market the world bank start offer grant to the farmer for purchas seed now the world bank is discontinu the practic have patent the seed it will be compulsori for everi farmer to purchas seed onli from the multin compani if they are not abl to purchas the seed world bank will give them loan not grant we will continu to get loan and after ten year the pressur of world bank will increas again western countri are pressuris us to accept intellectu properti right and patent right altogeth it is a conspiraci to enslav us q the east india compani came to india for busi and after some time it rule the countri is it not a similar conspiraci hatch by western countri a it is the same situat again there are onli two thing differ now then it wa onli the east india compani now there are 18 20 compani secondli the east india compani had recours to gunpowd now they do not need gunpow they want to have their man in the financ ministri their econom work like gunpowd and our financ ministri ha been do the job of the gunpowd i think we are face with three world crimin world bank imf and gatt q what will be the impact of the dunkel propos on our agricultur research a the veri basi of our agricultur research will be destroy in my opinion there are two type of agricultur research in india firstli that which is done by the farmer himself and secondli the scientist s no farmer in india engag in farm without think without understand and without the basic tradit knowledg now the indian govern is cut down the fund for the agricultur univers under pressur of the world bank it is a suicid step if the dunkel propos are accept the agricultur sector will ceas to be under our own govern for whom will the agricultur scientist then do the research multin compani will not do the research themselv our ph ds m a s and scientist in their research univers will be exploit and their talent misus to fool our farmer in thi situat indigen agricultur research will suffer and our farmer will have to grow onli that which the multin compani provid q at present there are more than 1 800 multin compani in india more than 300 multin compani enter india after the govern implement the new econom polici these compani have occupi everi product field in india which ha sever affect our tradit industri mani nationalist organis and polit parti have appeal to the countrymen that they should use onli indigen good and boycott the multin compani product do you think it would be right a as far as i think what provid job and food for peopl is swadeshi as long as our weaver will not have work how will they subsist patronis pepsi chip will be like take step against our farmer as our farmer will then be remov from product so i start the swadeshi movement from the peopl not the product we should not see what product come from which compani we should see which hand make it if the hand are swadeshi the product will be swadeshi q sever movement have been launch for the boycott of multin product do you think it will affect the product of those compani a if we continu the movement for the boycott of multin compani it will destroy the monster like cargil and pepsi i say it without hesit that an indian attack on these compani will sure affect their product q india ha an independ outlook and approach on environ if view of our approach there should be no problem of imbal in ecolog and environ do you think we can preserv our environ without foreign help a there is no need for foreign help onc we start get foreign help for environ it will not be use for our countri becaus the philosophi of the western countri is busi orient even parent child relationship is materialist their outlook on and approach to life is differ from our they exploit natur we are onli milk it q what role can women play in maintain ecolog balanc a women have been play a veri effect role in india sinc yore in our chipko movement women themselv come forward chiefli veri simpl villag women everi indian woman ha a great philosophi about environ we should take their think serious and also includ them in everi movement q basic you are a physicist how did you come to interest yourself in environ and agricultur a there are two reason the reason for which i had gone into the field of physic is the same for my come into the field of agricultur and environ i am a human be befor be a scientist my human ha brought me into thi field q in the past two year you won four intern award how do you feel about it a it make no differ q whom will you give the credit for thi a to my parent and my famili with their help i have reach thi stage usual mani restrict are put on the woman in our societi but my parent did not confin me to ani convent they help me at everi step q indian polit ha undergon great chang old parti have lost the support of the peopl and new parti and leader are come into power what do you expect from the new parti and the new leader at thi transit stage a there is no worthwhil polit leadership in our countri apart from the polit parti there are some honest and true leader in social movement i hope that they would lead the fight against fraud and corrupt q although larg scale industri creat ecolog imbal but in prefer to rural industri they are necessari for develop do you see ani util for the rural sector a we should give due import to the rural industri wherev they can be more use than the larg scale industri abolish the rural industri will never be in the interest of indian economi
