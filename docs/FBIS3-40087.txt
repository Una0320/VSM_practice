and time and although they face differ histor contradict and histor task and gain differ histor victori nevertheless the two leap were permeat with a common essenc and substanc thi wa that they adher to the ideolog line of seek truth from fact and follow china s own road of revolut and construct adher to the ideolog line of seek truth from fact and take china s own road of revolut and construct are the most basic histor experi of all the histor experi summar in mao zedong thought and comrad deng xiaop s build of a distinct chines brand of social they success transform the scientif tenet of

emancip think can the seek of truth from fact be attain onli the seek of truth is fact is a true emancip of think comrad deng xiaop is a paragon of uphold the parti s ideolog line of seek truth from fact he is a paragon of adher to and develop of mao zedong thought comrad deng xiaop ha repeatedli emphas that emancip of think and seek truth from fact is the essenc that permeat the entir point of view of the theori of build a distinct chines brand of social in studi the new volum of the select work of deng xiaop we must grasp thi essenc and clutch thi substanc firmli we must adher to practic be the sole criterion for test truth in the cours of practic we must adher to truth and develop truth we must reject dogmat interpret of certain marxist principl and marxist write reject understand of social that are not scientif or that distort it reject incorrect idea about skip the preliminari state of social resolut oppos erron point of view that basic repudi marxism and uphold the use of the world outlook and methodolog of dialect materi and histor materi in analyz and solv problem we must constantli improv our percept as histori advanc as time develop and as practic deepen the achiev we have made stem from the emancip of think and the seek of truth from fact if we are to make even greater achiev in the futur we must like depend on the emancip of think and the seek of truth from fact new situat and new task are place new requir on our emancip of think and seek of truth from fact we must continu to emancip think and seek truth from fact so that our idea and understand meet constantli chang situat thi is a matter that we must understand befor studi the third volum of the select work of deng xiaop in studi the third volum of the select work of deng xiaop not onli must we profoundli understand that the emancip of think and the seek of truth from fact are import ideolog premis for maintain and develop mao zedong thought but we must profoundli understand and grasp that on a seri of import issu particularli basic issu such as what is social and how to build social how comrad deng xiaop s theori on the build of a distinct chines brand of social build is a continu and develop of marxism and mao zedong thought comrad deng xiaop ha said in carri out reform and open up to the outsid world and in place the work emphasi on build the economi we have not abandon marxism lenin or mao zedong thought we cannot abandon the forefath he also said follow the third plenari session we reviv the correct thing of comrad mao zedong we studi and appli mao zedong thought in a correct and integr way the basic point are still the same in mani way today we are still do thing that comrad mao zedong propos but did not do we are do thing well that he did not do well for a fairli long time to come we will be do well these thing and we will also be develop but we will also have to continu to develop he also note that true marxist leninist must base on current circumst understand continu and develop marxism lenin thi is becaus the world is constantli chang in particular modern scienc and technolog are develop veri rapidli what use to be done in the old societi in sever decad or as much as a centuri or even a longer period is done in a singl year nowaday therefor true marxist must make their think catch up with and meet rapidli develop circumst they cannot fall behind thi is like the reason lenin is a truli great marxist is that he found the revolutionari road not in book but in realiti logic philosoph idea and communist theori the great marxist leninist mao zedong did not seek in the book of marx and lenin the way to win victori in the new democrat revolut in backward china could marx have predict that the octob revolut would occur in a backward russia could lenin have forecast that the use of rural villag to surround the citi could be use to attain victori in china therefor true marxist must boldli pioneer and innov comrad deng xiaop s theori of
