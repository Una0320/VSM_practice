no nation or more precis nationalist prefer in personnel polici a mechan of appropri and occup suitabl is at work here look at the entir administr hierarchi and you will see repres of all peopl and if turkmen still prevail that is not surpris after all they make up 80 percent of the popul zoriny one get the impress that the leader of turkmenistan have some kind of cautiou attitud toward the ci shikhmuradov it seem to mani peopl that the ci is a new version of the former union where there is a singl center to which one can turn on ani occas thi as we see it is an incorrect view of it in the ussr relat between the center and the union republ were alway like those of a rider and a hors two year of experi with the ci have convinc us that even the most difficult problem in relat among state can and should be resolv in bilater negoti as we know the shortest distanc between two point is a straight line and the creation under the label of the ci of ani center a strict coordin structur is a third point which if it doe not distort at least lengthen thi straight line we want to reserv the right to choos what is advantag and what is disadvantag base on our own nation interest zoriny whose experi would you like to emul in your reform shikhmuradov we have studi variou model of socioeconom develop and familiar ourselv with the experi of turkey the unit state franc china india and pakistan and still we have creat our own pure turkmen model of transit to the market it take into account our countri s specif featur it custom and tradit and even it behavior stereotyp base on thi we have publish a program call 10 year of well be we need 10 year of stabil and interethn harmoni in order to conduct the reform more quickli dure thi period we must solv two problem simultan build an independ state and chang from a central to a market economi and at the same time we shall provid social guarante for the peopl so that the difficulti of the transit will not be reflect pain among the popul as is frequent the case zoriny judg from what i have seen you have not alway succeed at the latter the store are rather empti the main food product are bought with ration card and the price went up again after the introduct of the nation currenc therefor let us move from the materi sphere to question of spiritu life accord to the constitut turkmenistan is a secular state but the highest repres of the muslim clergi particip in the work of all the most import confer the presid of turkmenistan ha issu an edict on studi the fundament of religion in school is thi not turn out that the reviv of interest in islam is move and take hold at the top and is thi not pander to fundamentalist forc shikhmuradov for mani long year our peopl were physic separ from religion even though it is a part of their spiritu life and if the return to islam seem overli activ now one must allow for what you might call a thirst on the part of a peopl yearn for their own custom and tradit the peopl gener their cultur and religion is a part of it as for threat of muslim fundament i want to say that turkmen have never been religi fanat and such a threat doe not exist zoriny doe the return of islam to the spiritu life of societi mean that the tradit associ with it will also be reviv polygami bride money etc shikhmuradov you are talk about thing that are under church jurisdict but in our countri it is separ from the state therefor these question are neither discuss nor resolv at the state level zoriny that is they are not encourag and they are not condemn shikhmuradov the main thing is for the activ of religi organ to be in keep with the constitut and the church ha obey the law of the countri thi more or less insur us against ani extrem against religi extrem zoriny it is known that you have retain censorship and that there is onli one parti the democrat formerli communist parti and the opposit ha been ban yet accord to it constitut turkmenistan is not onli a secular but also a democrat state so whom should we believ the constitut or real life shikhmuradov our constitut actual doe contain such a stipul but i want to emphas that we are now at the veri begin of the path to a democrat societi we are convinc that it is imposs to creat a democraci overnight it requir a certain transit period which we are now go through it is imposs to jump from totalitarian to a free societi in a singl hour whenev we begin to agit the unpolitic mass where doe it lead the politician remain sit in their offic and the peopl on the street shed blood it is our duti to spare peopl from such thing therefor the principl of moder and weigh step in conduct democrat transform is fundament for us we are now be accus of not have a multiparti system no we will not permit it just so that we can be call democrat becaus we are to respons to our peopl s choic i want to emphas that democraci is our ultim goal but the main thing we must do on the path to it is chang the peopl s attitud toward properti we have alreadi proclaim the right to ownership of the land and we have adopt a whole packag of law which show the irrevers of our movement toward the market we think that onli with the creation of a class of owner will there appear a basi for polit reform and democrat we are move toward and will definit arriv at a normal democrat societi but onli on our own path
