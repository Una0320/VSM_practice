cso f p 106 articl by kieu xuan sang f text editor s note at the end of 1993 minist of energi thai phung ne answer a number of report question about the implement of the 1993 plan and the 1994 task of the energi sector the follow are some of the idea of the minist h5 i the implement of the 1993 plan h5 1 on electr product and suppli in 1993 both product and commod electr suppli to satisfi econom and social need exceed the plan and increas as compar with 1992 product electr reach 10 641 billion kwh 5 29 percent abov the plan norm and an increas of 10 25 percent as compar with 1992 commod electr reach 7 794 billion kwh 4 14 percent abov the plan norm and an increas of 12 45 percent as compar with 1992 the program to overcom electr shortag in southern and central vietnam wa carri on activ in the south as a result of ad anoth 100 mw ga turbin and fill the reservoir of the tri an and da nhim hydroelectr plant at the end of last year and becaus of the measur use to mobil the variou sourc of electr both product and suppli electr exceed the plan and increas greatli as compar with 1992 specif product electr exceed the plan by 9 18 percent and increas 16 48 percent as compar with 1992 and commod electr exceed the plan by 8 71 percent and increas 16 69 percent as compar with 1992 thi ensur a normal suppli of electr dure the dri season and prevent electr blackout as in previou year in central vietnam too the distribut of electr improv becaus of the use of measur to strengthen obtain electr from the northern system and bring electr to quang ngai and binh dinh in conjunct with regul the diesel sourc of electr among the region becaus of thi as compar with 1992 the electr receiv and produc increas 18 48 percent and commod electr increas 17 6 percent bring electr to rural and mountain area ha continu to expand at present more than 81 percent of the district and more than 55 percent of the villag in the countri are receiv electr from the nation electr network the sector ha coordin thing with the local in order to expand the program to reduc electr energi loss veri encourag initi result have been achiev in key area in haiphong citi januari energi loss in haiphong citi amount to 52 66 percent but by novemb the figur had drop to 29 percent in hanoi januari loss amount to 31 4 percent but by novemb thi had declin to 23 5 percent use mani guidanc and control measur the sector ha striven to reduc the plan deficit as much as possibl in addit to the 100 billion dong contribut to reduc the deficit effort have been made to further reduc the deficit in order to creat sourc of invest capit for a number of urgent capit construct project the sector must continu to strive to reduc the electr loss norm in the north it is now higher than the norm set reduc failur rate improv safeti and increas the prestig of the electr network particularli that of the electr distribut network and control the price of electr sold retail to consum in rural area 2 on coal product and suppli even though there are mani difficulti concern distribut market within the countri the thermoelectr plant still use veri small amount of coal and coal export are limit becaus of mani factor becaus the coal sector ha use mani control measur such as increas intern sale to household outsid the electr sector and export small amount and gradual rais domest coal price to almost the level of product cost the amount of wash coal produc and sold ha exceed the plan norm and increas as compar with 1992 the amount of wash coal produc reach 4 768 million ton which is 100 5 percent of the plan norm and a 6 percent increas as compar with 1992 the amount of wash coal sold reach 5 032 million ton which is 100 3 percent of the plan norm and a 3 7 percent increas as compar with 1992 the valu of coal sale revenu increas 5 4 percent as compar with the plan therebi contribut to reduc the difficulti with respect to financi balanc in product and the incom of the labor the sector and local have coordin thing to continu restor order in coal product and circul base on mine boundari there are mani reason for the problem now confront the coal sector in particular becaus of fluctuat in the world coal market in 1993 coal export did not reach the plan norm and declin as compar with 1992 becaus of the lack of financi balanc it ha not been possibl to remov the volum of overburden and dig the number of shaft in accord with the technic requir in the mine process and thi ha affect the prepar of natur resourc 3 on capit construct in 1993 with the concentr of state invest the energi sector implement a larg number of capit construct project sourc of electr turbin 6 and 7 of the hoa binh hydroelectr plant were put on line and prepar were made for put the final turbin into oper by the begin of 1994 the thac mo hydroelectr project block the be river in decemb 1993 togeth with the vinh son hydroelectr plant construct on thi plant is progress base on a schedul of put turbin 1 into oper in june 1994 and complet construct on the project by the end of 1994 construct on the yali hydroelectr project got underway at the begin of novemb 1993 electr project to support the 1994 dri season in the south which includ the ba ria 100 mw ga turbin group and the ba ria long binh 220 kv landlin are be construct at a rapid pace three larg project to help satisfi electr need dure the period 1996 2000 and in the futur are the phu my thermoelectr project 600 mw the pha lai ii thermoelectr project 600 mw and the ham thuan da mi hydroelectr group 472 mw effort have been concentr on carri out procedur in order to take oda offici develop assist loan from the japanes govern the electr network construct on the 500 kv north south electr carrier system ha been step up the technic plan have been complet and an overal estim ha been submit to the premier contract for import materi and equip have been sign and except for the electr cabl which arriv late almost all of the project materi and equip arriv on time as for construct in decemb 1993 the foundat wa complet and the pillar were erect includ the reinforc stretch the carrier line and light arrest line wa basic complet some of the construct work on the four transform station one compens station and nation electr moder center ha been complet and some of the equip ha been instal along with the rate of construct on the 500 kv system construct is urgent be carri on on the connect project landlin and synchron 110 and 220 kv station with the abov sourc in order to use the 500 kv carrier system to suppli electr to southern and central vietnam and the central highland in 1993 mani project to suppli electr to local in northern central and southern vietnam were complet thi includ mani project to suppli electr to rural and mountain area the coal sector ha invest use the loan mechan in order to remov overburden and dig shaft work ha begun on the nam cau trang tippl and the tay khe sim tunnel prepar have been made to build the la hien cement plant and plant to produc explos and process coal and a number of other support project have been built in the capit construct activ of the energi sector the sector ha begun broadli implement a bid mechan and welcom competit in suppli materi and equip in order to reduc cost ensur qualiti and maintain the rate of construct on the project 4 on machin product the product of the machin instal ha continu to be shift in the direct of manufactur equip to support the project to develop energi and vari the product base on market need such as machin and electropl electr rod for the 500 kv and 110 and 220 kv carrier project produc carrier line lighten arrest line and insul cabl machin pressur tube for the hydroelectr plant manufactur high voltag circuit breaker spare part annex and so on to support the product and construct activ of the electr and coal sector 5 other sphere financ state budget receipt have been maintain and as mention abov an effort ha been made to reduc the plan deficit by hundr of billion of dong fight corrupt and oppos neg aspect inspect have been conduct and 18 698 case of corrupt and other neg activ have been dealt with among these were 8
