accord and the equal of all nation and nation have been laid down all thi strictli speak is a firm foundat for the consist implement of the reform but it would be an illus to believ that chang in the social conscious occur automat with a chang in polit and econom system thi is a far more seriou and complex phenomenon inasmuch as it is connect with deep lie process of social life and chang in world outlook principl and psycholog stereotyp and the veri tenor of the life of societi and each person individu we have all today come in for a dual load as it were it is as though both the economi and societi find themselv between past and present even while have fulli recogn that there is no road back we must acknowledg that the system of manag scienc cultur educ and spiritu life invis bear the imprint of the past the same is happen in the social conscious also such a concept as anomi the state of man s confus under sharpli chang condit when the establish valu system is reinterpret and there is a radic chang in life s valu becam firmli establish in scholarship back last centuri thi is a difficult test not onli for the individu citizen but for the whole of societi also and despit the fact that an absolut major of kazakhstani support the reform polici we must recogn that mani peopl while have apprehend the need for chang with their heart so to speak have yet to grasp their essenc intellectu and are experienc uncertainti lack an entir clear idea of their futur the state of a certain spiritu discomfort is be intensifi by the econom crisi which for the ordinari individu ha been express primarili in the uncheck growth of price a fall in the live standard and the unresolv natur of mani social problem extrem of the polit struggl frequent disori peopl also the most unexpect polit specul sometim find for itself a nich in the social conscious in order to understand the situat shape up in the polit sphere of kazakhstan today it is necessari to close analyz the substanc of the idea that are be activ discuss in the press in the parti polem in econom circl and ye in broad strata of societi perhap grant the entir complex pictur of polit view and there is a great collect of them it would seem necessari to examin the socialist and liber view as two pole of the current social and polit divers of cours thi is somewhat of a simplif but one that make it possibl to see the pictur as a whole the socialist platform ha certain support in societi although it is unlik that it could be taken as a basi in reform the period of wholesal critic of the socialist idea ha pass the time ha come for a seriou analysi of what wa done for the peopl by social in it soviet version and of what simpli cannot be accept the creation in kazakhstan in the year of soviet power of a power industri and agricultur and uniqu product engin complex univers literaci urban and much els would have been imposs without kazakhstan s industri our present potenti is to some extent the result of the former system onli in polem over excit could thi be deni orthodox support of the socialist idea are speak with nostalgia about the past and insist on it return and the institut of proceed against politician for their crime virtual the illog of frame the issu thi way is astonish while alway urg a consider of the object regular in histori the opposit is today put the emphasi on person and incident or temporari factor of cours individu leader of that time did perform some role in acceler the disintegr of the state but if we keep to an object not emot viewpoint it is obviou that social wa in the most profound crisi as a system of socioeconom and polit relat it may today be said affirm that it is a question of a crisi of extens proport econom crisi a key criterion of the effici of social system is econom effici by thi criterion the central plan economi had ultim conclus lost out to the market economi polit crisi the contradict between the state power of the peopl and the concentr of power in the hand of a veri narrow elit of the intraparti bureaucraci had reach it logic conclus formal polit structur creat the semblanc of democraci but in realiti all decis at the local and central level were made onli by the parti leader nation crisi despit the proclaim internation the socialist system most brutal suppress the free develop of the nation for decad specif in kazakhstan more than half the kazakh peopl perish or emigr accord to expert estim in the year of forcibl collectiv all peopl of the countri sustain coloss loss nation crisi is larg the creation of econom crisi the relat of the center and the region were of a semicoloni natur the raw materi focu of the republ s economi and it noncomprehens natur were deliber predetermin to the same extent kazakhstan wa tightli tie to the center and other region in a transport system whose purpos wa to make an independ outlet onto the foreign market imposs onli the threat of violenc held back the hidden intern tension when the system fell apart the territori of the former ussr flare up in intern conflict and war thi is not the fault of peopl but the fault of past and present politician violenc from the direct physic extermin of whole peopl through the constrict of the sphere of applic of nation languag had driven the contradict deep down there were no other method for their resolut despit all the statement about internation behind the facad of offici ideolog steadi neg stereotyp took shape in some peopl in respect to other which at the everyday level are aliv today also the attempt to standard all nation in a singl super ethnic commun the soviet peopl had manifestli fail further ecolog crisi the particular featur of the socialist econom system with it abstract nationwid but in practic department ownership led to coloss ecolog malfeas on the part of the ministri and depart the essenc of the problem is that while dispos uncheck of the land and natur resourc the depart at the same time were not interest in environment clean industri and bore no real respons for the inevit tragedi thi no one s properti phenomenon brought about global catastroph without preced in previou histori the lack of ecolog standard result in the confront of societi and natur kazakhstan found itself in an extrem seriou situat in thi respect one of the biggest disast wa brought the kazakh peopl by the semipalatinsk nuclear test site conduct nuclear weapon test underground includ in kazakhstan the system perpetr one of the most monstrou crime in the histori of mankind against the citizen of it own state over half a million person have suffer from radiat in our republ alon mani of them have alreadi depart thi life at the height of their power hundr of thousand have been depriv of their health forev sever gener of children have been condemn from birth to live as invalid and the tragedi continu in mani famili which are give birth to crippl anoth catastroph which came to kazakhstan is the aral sea which is disappear from the face of the earth thi calam ha subject the peopl of the vast central asia region to untold suffer and not onli them scientist have drawn a substanti conclus concern the global destruct influenc of the aral cataclysm on vast territori of the planet but those who have suffer most from these experi present by the former regim as struggl for the bright futur are primarili the peopl of kazakhstan we have still to talli the entir damag inflict on peopl the land and natur as a whole if onli to estim the true dimens of the catastroph and to determin measur to elimin their consequ and the world also should have a clear idea of the actual ecolog situat in kazakhstan moral crisi there wa a discrep between the ideolog symbol and peopl s real valu the dual moral of the govern elit could not have fail to have brought about the similar moral of million of peopl formal particip in variou polit activ meet demonstr march and so forth yet absolut disbeliev of the proclaim slogan when today there is bewilder as to whi the system fell apart so easili it is simpli forgotten that it had long sinc lost the confid of the peopl who saw and understood our grow lag behind the west and the soviet economi s acceler slide into crisi socialist ideal in recent year evok noth more than ironi all thi wa known but ideolog obdur continu to serv the ambit of the rule elit and to pass off it interest as all state interest let us recal the myth of soviet homespun ideolog divorc from realiti the theori of the merger of the nation the practic of the relationship of state and individu when the latter wa assign the role of cog and the implant parti minded of scienc literatur and art even such natur feel as love for the motherland concern for the futur fidel to the tradit of one s ancestor all thi wa fit into the procrustean bed of the moral code of the builder of commun thi wa not an ideolog but a kind of specul on peopl s moral principl but it should be consid that for mani peopl forswear old illus is a veri pain process mock their convict is imposs engag in a compet and honest polem is anoth matter it is essenti to explain as lucidli as possibl that under modern condit equal via state redistribut state patern ideolog uniform and the suppress of privat properti and the market would repel kazakhstan from the world commun a return to the past is futil and could mere deton societi and lead to civil war it is no less import to recogn that the ubiquit assert myth of social of the kind we experienc have collaps not onli in the ci but throughout the world despit a number of achiev of thi system use and realiz in practic we cannot finish up at a histor dead end yet again anoth direct of social thought put the emphasi on tradit and nation charact the ideolog of tradition is logic connect with the crisi of socialist ideolog truli to what can we turn if the previou tenet have proven bankrupt to most like that which is most simpl comprehens and at the same time profoundli moral and spiritu in the life of each peopl tradit their role in the life of the peopl is indisput cultur tradit have alway been a sourc of social reviv a return to one s histor cultur root is of cours a posit process in addit it is necessari to abandon the simplist interpret of the relationship of tradit and social progress the experi of the modern world show convincingli that certain tradit structur are veri organ interwoven in the fabric of the present civil without experi innov is imposs also it is tradit that enabl a person to keep hi bear and adapt hi way of life to the impetu chang of the modern world develop of the nation languag art cultur everyday cultur includ and the famili is entir support in kazakhstan but the polit ideolog of the tradit type which is base on a resuscit of archaic form of social arrang tribal mental and a system of legal view characterist of the territori organ of kazakh societi of the 18th 19th centuri is categor reject here the immens space occupi by kazakh on territori from the caspian to china requir some structur formal and particular center of attract thi coincid with the particular featur of histor develop of differ region and wa accompani subsequ by a system of administr divis conscious introduc by tsarism on the other hand the singular of manag of the economi also requir a precis regul of territori issu region affili therefor ha primordi play an appreci role in the polit arrang but do we need to bring all thi into the 21st centuri after all under modern condit the rate of develop of the social and cultur system of the kazakh peopl are absolut incommensur with that period thu despit the aspir understand to some extent to find in our own histori effect polit mechan we need to be realist and to recogn that the polit idea and polit symbol of past age are not suitabl for the end of the present centuri even in the past incident our great educ call for the prevent of a stratif of kazakh societi also popular in social circl are liber idea at the end of the 1980 s and at the start of the present decad the gener euphoria at their triumph and the affirm of ideal common to all mankind and the right and liberti of man as the highest valu led to the optimist conclus as to the conclus victori of democraci and democrat principl but there ha come to be a gradual understand throughout the world that complex process also are occur against the background of liber ideolog not to touch on other region of the world but to speak about our former common space mention ha to be made of the grow social tension in societi which is express at time in the most extrem form arm conflict polit confront econom anarchi and peopl s unbelief in the possibl of chang anyth instead of the growth of a civil market specul capit in all sphere financ trade foreign econom relat walk side by side with two companion crimin element and the corrupt nomenklatura these process have noth in common with the modern world market but they exist in realiti manifestli contradict the veri essenc of liber ideolog intern conflict on the other hand graphic demonstr that argument about democraci and valu common to all mankind are not as yet capabl of protect human life and digniti of cours the contradict between liber ideolog and harsh realiti may be explain by refer to the legaci of totalitarian thi would be correct but onli partli so there are more profound reason liber ideal and liber ideolog are the result of the extens centuri long evolut of western civil the basi of these is compos of object prerequisit privat properti the mental of individu and democrat polit institut it rudiment with us were either absent or were interrupt almost a centuri ago in addit a strong legal system facilit the realiz of liber idea wa creat in civil state outsid of these object prerequisit thi process is extraordinarili more difficult the fact that the main and most popul support of the ideolog of liber the middl class as it is customarili call in social scienc doe not exist in the republ as yet ha to be seen also account should be taken of the actual cultur and histor situat as well the point be that with a mechan transfer of western liber ideolog to kazakhstan it propon would come up against such a phenomenon as cultur in the broad includ polit sens it natur and ideal cannot be chang in an instant the type of polit cultur need to be transform gradual in civil fashion and on the basi of real reform thu an analysi of the polit and ideolog direct in present day kazakhstan testifi to the need for the search for particular path in the format of the ideolog platform we do not reject that which is valuabl that ha accumul within it socialist and tradit and liber view but the task confront kazakhstan requir in our view the conceptu of somewhat differ nation ideolog prioriti h5 toward real independ h5 we speak about the transit period what is it substanc to what do we aspir there are a whole number of specif econom and polit direct which are set forth in the constitut document of the execut and the legislatur and the program of certain parti of kazakhstan but asid from the specif task there is also a global purpos without have achiev which we cannot success move forward along the path of the reform of societi it is a question of the achiev of the real independ of the republ despit it numer attribut and the recognit and assert of sovereignti to say that kazakhstan ha acquir full independ would be prematur we must in the next few year concentr all effort on thi process we have for thi to resolv gener speak the follow key problem to strengthen state principl build a state base on the rule of law and ensur the format of a full fledg nation market on a new product engin structur and institut basi such a formul of the issu will most like meet with the understand of parti and public movement the work forc entrepreneuri circl research and artist organ and repres of all strata of the popul of the republ inasmuch as the said prioriti are of an all state natur and their realiz could effect the profound modern of kazakhstani societi if we seek so necessari a consensu we should also agre with such an inevit condit the achiev of real independ requir strong polit intellectu and spiritu support it is essenti that we secur not onli an econom organiz and personnel breakthrough in these direct but also creat an atmospher consolid societi and we have to have here an ideolog comprehens of our realiti gear both to the immedi and the more distant futur one of the main polit aspect for us in the impend work is the strengthen of statehood on the whole thi is a natur infer from the experi of world civil an object need for an increas in the regulatori influenc of the state which is essenti primarili to secur the emerg from the crisi and stabil of the socioeconom and social and polit situat is necessarili manifest in an era of profound crise and upheav we should concentr the main effort here on enhanc the role and respons of the execut strengthen the vertic line of manag and form strong presidenti rule both parliament and societi as a whole agre on the need for an intensif of thi process to which the quit precis alloc of function of the three branch of power in the countri s basic law testifi but the format of the state of kazakhstan is not confin mere to adopt of the constitut especi sinc it wa stipul from the veri outset that it is a constitut of a transit period which ha been creat it reflect the realiti of our present day and the complex and contradict of our societi it provis and requir are bind on all but it is necessari to ponder the prospect look into the futur even now the present suprem council is fulfil it histor mission and perform a great deal of work lay the foundat of the countri s legisl base the next stage of societ develop will inevit requir us to creat a profession parliament with clearli defin duti and power it is import also that we reach a common opinion on which of the world s preval and approv elector system is the optimum and which of them is applic for our republ the next task is the legisl separ of the power of the central state and local author in term of which the execut and repres author local are suffici plenipotentiari in the solut of their problem the central structur would then be reliev of divers current busi and could concentr on the strateg direct of polit econom and social develop it is essenti to reform the judici system also unfortun peopl still have no faith in the author and compet of the judici author local it is as yet too earli to speak of the object of the court and the construct natur of their activ they are divorc from the problem of societi as it were it is necessari to make the judici system as effici as possibl and to rid it of the possibl which still exist of pressur be exert on the part of the power structur in the local particularli a most practic path of thi reform is the legisl enshrin of the appoint of judg by the head of state follow a recommend of a special suprem judici council say we could thi way ensur the genuin independ of the judg and cut short ani encroach on justic as we can see the process of the format of kazakhstani statehood is a complex labori and divers task and there should be no ill consid hast or unwarr slow here it is import to secur the mutual understand and interact of all branch of power we would be do futur gener a bad turn were we to loosen the foundat of the state for the sake of momentari polit benefit the accomplish of radic socioeconom reform undoubtedli belong among the main nation prioriti thi is a key question of modern kazakhstan and it acquisit of independ the fate of the reform is directli link with the mechan of state control of the polit sphere inasmuch as kazakhstan s develop of recent decad ha been character by veri complex and larg scale process it is in thi period that a number of global program have been realiz on the territori of the republ these includ the develop of the virgin and fallow land the creation of industri s coloss raw materi base and nuclear and space research but the nation social and cultur problem introduc into kazakhstan by the realiz of these program went unstudi and uncomprehend behind the econom and militari aspect of these process a qualit chang occur for the first time the proport of the urban popul exceed that of the rural popul the uneven of the develop of the region increas sharpli there wa a chang in the nation composit of the popul on account of the huge immigr from the european part of the countri a sizabl group of an urban kazakh popul with the concentr of the bulk of the nation in the countrysid appear all of thi could not have fail to have led to the appear of veri strong differ in polit and cultur orient at the same time on the other hand the ostens ideolog uniti wa deliber emphas and exagger and the differ and problem were ignor as a result the ideolog and polit contradict of differ strata of the popul grew today they are come to be manifest activ it is for thi reason that the mold of a new econom philosophi now occupi a special place thi is connect primarili with it direct influenc on an acceler of the progress of the reform the ideolog of a democrat rule of law societi base on a plural of idea is noth other than a reflect of view on the form of ownership and manag we have set as the strateg goal the format of genuin market mechan and a social orient multistructur market economi that is we have opt for the path of the creation of a societi in which econom liberti and the econom interest of the individu are indisput and where the free express of belief and spiritu valu is guarante by the state and the law but owe to the tenac of past ideolog stereotyp the affirm of these norm can hardli be painless it is no secret that instanc of the open reject of the reform at both the power and the everyday level are far from isol with us what is to be done in thi situat opt for a hard line polici establish the direct diktat of the state organ the persecut of the opposit for critic of the govern there have been mani exampl of thi in the contemporari histori of the implement of econom reform incident the actual social and polit situat in kazakhstan enabl us to avoid such power action lower the republ s intern prestig it need mere to be emphas that both on the issu of a strengthen of statehood and in the economi there ha to be a mutual aspir of the govern and the main polit movement and parti to a converg of posit on question of the reform it is not of cours a question of some class appeas and a ban on construct critic of the action of the govern and the formul of altern program the danger lie elsewher as the experi of certain ci countri testifi it consist of intern and polit destabil which certainli is in the interest of no polit parti and no singl inhabit of multin kazakhstan a cultur civil dialogu with all who are sincer interest in kazakhstan s breakthrough in econom space and time is essenti it is necessari to take account of all thi and to formul the basic principl of ideolog in the econom sphere they are gear to the creation of a social orient mix market economi base on a combin of the competit self regul of product and regul of the basic paramet of econom develop on the part of the state support for nation enterpris in all it form with the prioriti of privat enterpris in the sector directli produc materi asset in the sphere of servic construct transport and trade the structur reorgan of product and the surmount of it raw materi one sided with prioriti in the fuel and energi and iron and steel complex and the food and consum good market and in the develop of the system of servic line the social protect of the popul particularli the needi and handicap strata assur of employ and the surmount of unemploy and the unmanag in migrat process use of the econom advantag from the middl eurasian geopolit locat and pragmat in the choic of econom and polit partner in interst relat the market cannot be built without the mass recognit and accept of such categori as econom effici the person econom liberti of the individu and privat properti it is obviou that these categori cannot be firmli establish in the conscious without the correspond social base the format of which is onli just begin under these condit it is the state that assum the function of defens of the new econom ideolog without the activ ideolog support of the state a market mental simpli cannot take shape it is essenti to understand here that the real market presuppos not onli propaganda of it valu but also a masteri of the essenti mechan and skill it is obviou that in kazakhstan onli the state can undertak the larg scale train of personnel equip with thi set of instrument a strengthen of state principl should be accompani by the build of a societi base on the rule of law thi is a task of nation signific we are talk primarili about question of legal cultur and legal reform in the republ for without them there will be no social progress and independ will not be complet in a civil societi legal cultur is an essenti compon of the gener cultur of each individu and a qualif requir of each offici there need to be a most seriou discuss about thi inasmuch as without the establish of the proper rule of law we can hardli reform the economi and affirm democrat standard in the life of societi the market impli primarili the self regul of the relat of the commod produc and consum base on qualit law without precis oper legisl therefor there is no market nor can there be democraci requir state power clearli protect both against autocraci and against mob rule it can onli be protect via observ of bind legal procedur for both the violenc of the minor and the violenc of the major are equal danger without law therefor democraci is imposs freedom of the individu as the target idea of a state of civil presuppos the sovereignti of the individu and protect of hi inviol and digniti regardless of whether he is a child or adult employ or employ state offici or rank and file employe such legal equal is possibl onli if there is gener observ of the democrat adopt law onli the court can transform ani social conflict into a civil dialogu that is without the law there is no liberti it may observ that in term of it import and complex legal reform is the equival of econom reform the build of a state base on the rule of law need to begin with the state itself thi is a stringent demand of the market economi and the democrat societi if high qualiti law are lack the law have to be constantli amend and revis if the law do not oper telephon law as befor will if legal think doe not becom firmli establish in the conscious there will be those wish to encroach on the function of administr investig and justic if we truli intend build a civil societi in which the idea of right and ethic triumph each citizen must from hi school year assimil their elementari principl just as each of us know the elementari principl of mathemat like ani sovereign state kazakhstan will maintain a defens capabl and strengthen nation secur we have adopt a militari doctrin and a packag of militari law which specifi both measur to prevent war and method of defens of the sovereignti and territori integr of the republ our doctrin ha an exclus defens focu we take account here of the doctrin of the state of the ci and offer cooper with them in the accomplish of joint defens assign but howev the situat in militari question shape up onli polit method take account of the balanc of state interest are a civil method of the solut of intern problem and conflict settlement kazakhstan ha

illustri combat and labor tradit at the same time on the other hand it is essenti to establish in societi a respect attitud toward the defend of the fatherland militari servic should possess tremend prestig and the armi s author among the peopl must be made unshak much will depend here both on the men themselv and on the govern and public organ primarili those that work with the youth we must not allow an unhealthi atmospher to be creat around the armi or servicemen to feel themselv to be second class citizen strengthen the independ of the state we should continu the develop of the cours in foreign polici we are awar of the close attent to and increas interest in the intern orient of kazakhstan attempt to predetermin the vector of the republ s outlet to the outsid world are made openli or covertli from time to time it would seem extraordinarili import in thi connect to adher to a multipolar orient on the basi of our geograph locat and ethnodemograph and other factor the basi of our intern relat is an aspir to establish mutual profit polit socioeconom and cultur relat with all countri near and far take account of the salient featur of histor develop we are undoubtedli pay and

also the step connect with the conven of the confer on interact and confid build measur in asia and the activ of the asian econom cooper organ in foreign polici activ we will adher consist to the commonli accept intern standard and compli strictli with the commit we have assum and concern one other most import factor of the format of the sovereignti of kazakhstan inform independ without which the creation of an effici ideolog platform is imposs we are becom more and more extens a part of intern inform exchang which is undoubtedli a posit phenomenon but thi process cannot be interpret simplist an expans of the intern system of inform doe not mean an automat extens of democraci in the region inform channel in the world are distribut and load unevenli which is connect with the limit rang of languag of exposit of the inform and the differ level of state financi and technic possibl the young independ state frequent find themselv under the strong pressur of opinion impos from outsid as a result most complex intern process with their particular logic are evalu by an outsid view and frequent explain superfici and at time tendenti also thi result in a kind of barrier in the way of the establish of the genuin independ of mani state but close off outsid sourc of inform would mean for us self isol the solut is to see behind the inform announc the essenc of the polit principl the state is requir to regul the inform balanc thi is in no way contrari to the principl of an open societi and make it possibl at the same time to serious approach the achiev of genuin inform independ it is essenti here that our mass media learn to uphold the interest of the republ and creat their own inform space in the world s polit arena we need to win an audienc outsid of the republ especi sinc we have impress argument in support of our foreign and domest polici step such are the basic nation prioriti fidel to which will bring us onto the path lead to the achiev of real independ thi is possibl onli on condit of the creation in societi of an atmospher of consolid stabil and spiritu harmoni h5 toward ideolog consolid h5 it is hardli necessari today to convinc anyon that nation movement particularli in the young independ state are perform a coloss role it is they that are to a consider extent uphold nation interest express in a reviv of the self awar cultur spiritu tradit and languag of ani peopl these process are occur current in kazakhstan also realiz of the nation idea ha produc for societi mani posit result and it would be a big mistak not to see thi and to discern in nation natur aspir to self reviv mere a limit of the right of other or a sham appeal as a tribut to fashion to the past frequent of a decor natur no thi is a return to a normal human condit and the peopl of

entir popul of the republ is unit beneath these slogan today and all the more should they call for the nation uniti of the kazakh peopl anoth most import ideolog mission of our is the foster of kazakhstani patriot and the format of the clear self determin of each citizen specialist use for thi term self identif and it is by no mean a question of citizenship as such which pertain to legal act with a precis jurid mean there is an appreci differ between take out citizenship and recogn oneself to be a citizen unfortun the understand that henceforward we shall all be citizen of the independ sovereign state of kazakhstan not the former ussr or the ci is of a veri superfici natur moreov certain strata of the popul have lost their former ideal and not have acquir new one are today experienc a certain confus which is convert them into a sum total of the notori social atom the format on the other hand of genuin patriot and real civic presuppos the precis polit self determin of the person and a consciou choic of one s motherland it is essenti to formul a system of action which help each person feel proud of hi involv in our state it rich and illustri histori and it futur both the problem and prospect of the countri should be close and comprehens to all peopl thi task also concern the entir system of educ the cultur author public organ the mass media and each famili and we need to start with the inculc of a reverenti attitud toward the countri s flag coat of arm and anthem obedi to the law and respect for the author we need to ensur that each person assimil from hi childhood year the essenti simpl idea kazakhstan is my fatherland and i am respons for it as it is for me question of the establish in societi of high linguist cultur should also be in the channel of construct work on ideolog consolid thi problem ha becom heavili politic as of late although it should be view not from the standpoint of the exclus of the offici languag and it counterpois to other as peopl have attempt to do but on the contrari from it unifi role the kazakh languag as a part of the cultur should be an addit factor of the consolid of all kazakhstani it is the basi of cognit for all nation and nation of the cultur tradit custom and everyday life of the kazakh peopl studi thereof not compulsori but deliber should commenc for everyon from hi childhood year and be support organiz and method and everyon live here should clearli recogn the need for thi approach at the same time on the other hand all peopl should know that our legisl as a whole and the languag act in particular protect them against all restrict and persecut base on knowledg or ignor of the offici and ani other languag the question of an enhanc of the consolid role of the kazakh languag is pertin for the ad reason that in recent decad part of the kazakh youth ha come to be divorc from it nativ languag environ which ha occur on account of the artifici narrow of the sphere of use of the nativ languag thi problem can be tackl in entir civil fashion there is among thi part of the kazakh popul a rel great desir and readi to familiar itself with it nation root consequ we should not be exacerb the situat but creat the condit for fill in the gap moral sensit on the part of those for whom nation cultur and languag are natur and organ is need also speak of the languag problem it is essenti to link it with our gener goal kazakhstan aspir to join the world commun on a par with other linguist self isol is incompat with thi howev a channel of introduct to the immens flow of inform in the modern world is russian for thi reason knowledg of russian is a posit factor for the peopl of the republ on the whole it is essenti to inculc in young peopl of all nation an aspir to the constant enrich of linguist potenti the studi of european and orient languag today togeth with knowledg of one s own and the offici languag are a command of the time the state is requir to creat the necessari condit for studi in thi case also ani construct not destruct ideolog in kazakhstan should also take account of the fact that our state is not onli multin but also multicred a religi percept of the world is characterist of hundr of thousand of citizen and the number of follow of variou creed continu to grow there ha also been a chang in the place of religion in societi even recent it wa to put it mildli on the peripheri now it is a real compon of social and spiritu life the sphere of charit activ of religion specif in the field of health care educ and cultur the creation of kindergarten and retir home hospit and educ institut is expand it is common knowledg that valu common to all mankind are the basi of the moral principl of variou religion the religi commun are do a great deal to maintain in societi a healthi atmospher peac and harmoni and to establish spiritu it is import that the follow of variou creed can recogn their involv in the creation of the new statehood and have a vital interest in it strengthen and develop the renunci of the ideolog confront with religion and the adopt of the constitut and the law on freedom of religi belief and religi associ afford extens opportun in thi respect at the same time it is essenti to convey to the conscious of all that the secular natur of the state permit the most democrat solut of the question of free choic of ani religion or atheism and assur the equal of the creed also import is an understand that the separ of religi associ from the state not onli creat favor opportun for the satisfact of religi requir but also presuppos their noninterfer in the activ of all state institut and organ it is necessari to strive for fulfil of the provis of the constitut concern the impermiss of the creation of polit parti on a religi basi and the polit activ of religi associ we need to counteract attempt to use religi feel for instig conflict in societi and to promot the posit direct in the activ of the religion the effect of the new ideolog proposit on the other hand will also depend on how extens and success the dialogu of the main social forc includ the clergi of variou creed is conduct and to what extent it particip display a will to joint search for path of mutual understand and cooper in the name of the well be of the multin peopl of kazakhstan an appreci influenc on a strengthen of the consolid of societi is exert by the creation of an atmospher of stabil and civic harmoni much will depend here on the skill organ dialogu of the state and the new polit institut polit parti and public movement as a whole it is still too earli to speak of qualit and quantit evolv multiparti condit but we must foster in societi a toler of the view of polit oppon on the whole the opposit is a normal and even use phenomenon but the main thing is that parti and movement oper in a construct spirit and engag in critic in the true mean of thi word not carp we need idea and version of thi program or the other capabl of serv the common good not gener argument and alterc the state author are adher in relat to the parti and movement at the present time to a centrism contribut to observ of statewid interest not the interest of a

they adher and howev contradictori their platform can do much for the consolid of societi the trend of their unif in the form of a roundtabl is a fact of posit valu also extrem import is the role of the parti and public movement in the shape of polit cultur and the creation of polit tradit which are new for us without thi stabil and civic accord as the basi of consolid becom bare attain it is essenti to understand that we need stabil for the sake of continu of the reform and determin of their correct pace correspond to their particular stage specif a certain cultur adapt is need for the continu of privat that is we need to identifi the refer point at which we need to stop and close analyz the path that ha been cover not onli for the purpos of adjust but also with the aim of prepar and acclimat the public conscious to them such an approach is veri import in polit reform also we have conscious move to gradual transform the polit system although even thi is evok rebuk from the radic there should be no hast in personnel matter either incident stabil is immeasur more import to us the revolutionari leap forward syndrom is a veri danger ailment for societi sociopolit revolut are not the best way to develop the state a task of the present gener of kazakhstani is the creation of a societi in which mechan of the evolutionari type oper and in which it renew is consist the

modern amount at that time to affirm of the totalitarian idea in all sphere of societi it is thi uniform that we have to overcom unless societi is modern we will simpli lose the futur there would at worst be a restor of totalitarian in thi form or the other modern presuppos the format of a develop civil societi and thi incorpor primarili the sum total of voluntari associ of peopl the famili

vari from a fellowship of scientist or unoffici mass media through a sport club or econom organ final ideolog thi mean ideolog plural and real freedom of speech and freedom of worship the modern of kazakhstan presuppos the format of a civil societi which is a condit of the freedom of each citizen and the stabil of societi as a whole a certain modern of polit institut and the format of a mass democrat conscious are essenti in addit to thi utopian notion of democraci as some anarch freedom manifestli do not correspond to the polit arrang of truli democrat societi in actual fact the organ of polit life in them is somewhat differ polit there becom a sphere of profession activ and the popul particip in it via local govern elect and the mass media it is such an arrang not demonstr anarchi which is the indic of the stabil of democraci thi system includ a multiparti arrang and numer civic movement nation cultur center and econom and cultur foundat but the main thing is that in the civil

essenti also to effect a transit from group to individu choic in the new econom polit and cultur sphere the highest valu is individu liberti individu choic kazakhstan ha subscrib to intern legal instrument give individu freedom and choic prioriti not from tactic consider it is the ideolog axiom of the modern world the former system of group control ha alreadi been demolish it is essenti to creat mechan of inner self control which will requir a chang in the entir system of educ final it is essenti to determin the institut of realiz of the new ideolog platform in speak of the ideolog that ha depart our polit arena we mean that it institut and the immens machineri that work on it have disappear togeth with it also of cours there can be no question of it reconstitut inasmuch as we have proclaim entir differ principl and approach not onli to the content but also the organ of ideolog activ but as in ani democrat societi a system of the dissemin of modern knowledg essenti polit and
