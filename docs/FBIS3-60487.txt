research structur in thi area it is initi intend to fund the scheme with approxim 35 million german mark dm a year the follow individu topic will be cover the aid pandem ha made everyon awar of the health hazard to the popul pose when new pathogen appear with an estim 60 000 to 70 000 patient infect in germani alon sinc the outbreak of the pandem aid relat topic will continu to requir an enorm amount of work howev topic such as infect via tick bite lyme s borreliosi and the much debat possibl of the transfer to human of what is popularli known as mad cow diseas are also worth mention in thi connect these exampl illustr the need to creat suffici research capabl to meet new challeng effect the rapid increas in salmonella case in recent time ha shown how known pathogen spread the number of new infect ha doubl in onli 10 year to over 90 000 case a year the constant rise in the number of infect contract in hospit which constitut a grow problem for our health system is also a major issu here the phenomenon of resist to antibiot ha been known for a long time but ha recent becom a greater hazard with the advent of multiresist in tuberculosi pathogen and the progress develop of resist in the malaria tropica pathogen the transit of find from research into practic is still be hinder by a lack of cooper between basic research and clinician one of the reason whi thi is so in germani is that infecti diseas have low prioriti as a clinic special which inde is absent from most univers clinic three fund channel design specif to remedi these shortcom will therefor be use to continu exist bmft fund of research into infecti diseas the fund of joint research is intend to foster local region and nation interdisciplinari cooper the fund author specifi no particular topic so all area of appli research into infect are elig in order to place the studi of infecti diseas on a firmer institut foot structur aid for univers research facil and fund for redirect exist facil will be grant thi offer of financi prime over a limit period is design primarili to stimul and support research work in faculti of medicin which ha larg had to give way to routin health care work over recent decad a grant scheme will be avail to attract traine scientist to thi field thi scheme follow on from the establish aid grant scheme which will ceas to be exclus to work on aid in the futur as a rule fund will be provid for a two year term spent at a research facil of intern renown follow by a post at a german institut for a maximum of three year the bmft is current fund infecti diseas research under four main head aid shortli after the first case of the diseas were report in germani the bmft issu an initi annouc on research fund at the end of 1983 1984 saw the begin of the first project financ by

wuerzburg have been fund and 58 grant award overal approxim dm165 million have been spent to date on aid research in the initi stage it wa necessari to fund aid research under a singl program to react rapidli to a new health polici challeng german aid research ha attain a high standard although a solut to the aid problem cannot be expect in the short term the topic will therefor remain a major area for fund tropic medicin the bmft intend thi program to provid target fund for research on tropic medicin in area where the fund could be expect to promot long term structur improv the first measur
