system the steadi stream of research result is at the verg of blossom as reflect in the recent name chang from ultra high speed rail to magnet levit rail not onli is high speed sought but import is place on the low nois and eas of mainten characterist of a noncontact railway which ha a drive method that doe not depend on adhes and on energi conserv by use lighter weight car which is a featur of a primari ground system drive and control the car is mainli perform by ground facil sinc superconduct maglev rail possess these superior qualiti it is await not onli as a practic applic of superconduct but as a new mean of transport for the next gener h5 system improv h5 befor develop began at the railway technic research institut the mlu002 test vehicl wa complet in march 1987 and began trial run on the miyazaki test track howev quench the state where superconduct is not maintain occur frequent in the superconduct magnet the most import element in superconduct magnet levit therefor to move closer to practic realiz the whole system wa review and improv were made to the system by place import on stabil and reliabl the improv are as follow 1 from the perspect of the develop level of the superconduct magnet such as their durabl and reliabl the surfac propuls coil are place at two level with a phase of 240 deg where the electromagnet effect on the superconduct magnet becom small 2 to achiev improv reliabl of the superconduct magnet and low magnet field leakag into the car the pole pitch of the superconduct magnet is shorten thi action is taken becaus power suppli convers by a gto invert could be use 3 in order to increas energi save the method use is sidewal levit where the levit coil are shape like the number eight and have small magnet repuls forc magnet resist forc a larg levit forc is obtain by use sidewal levit these system chang are plan for use in the yamanashi test track therefor final perform verif is be perform on the miyazaki test track h5 recent major develop h5 as explain earlier the most import issu in implement a maglev railway is improv the stabil and reliabl of the superconduct magnet in order to solv thi problem the object wa to understand the quench phenomenon of superconduct magnet and suppress it occurr in the magnet with fund from all of the japan railway jr compani survey and test were perform on the electromagnet oscil characterist under a wide rang of test condit for superconduct magnet use electromagnet oscil test equip in addit prototyp of the superconduct coil and magnet were made by jr tokai quench resist test and electromagnet oscil test were conduct in parallel through these test a great deal of new inform wa gain on the effect of electromagnet oscil on heat gener in the superconduct magnet section moreov use insight wa gain on how to improv the characterist of the superconduct magnet s respons to electromagnet disturb the result of variou test and investig demonstr that the quench phenomenon is for the most part slide friction heat between the insid groov and the coil caus by an extern oscil forc superconduct magnet to be manufactur in the futur will have suffici margin in coil stabil stronger cross section coil structur and low current densiti thi seri of result is reflect in the design and manufactur of the superconduct magnet to be use in the newli construct mlu002n test vehicl and the yamanashi test vehicl the develop of wheel disc brake and tire that can be use from a speed of 500 km h in the car and the develop of an axl for the undercarriag and air brake were given prioriti variou repetit durabl and climat resist test were perform on the surfac coil in particular the mechan strength of the epoxi resin that is the mold materi for the sidewal levit coil wa care check also research and develop wa dilig perform on the coil instal method and on maintain instal precis in addit to the major effect these factor have on the difficulti or eas of construct they are import from the perspect of the feel of the ride a larg capac 10 mva class gto invert wa built as the ground facil for the miyazaki test track we analyz the major waveform characterist in it output characterist and high frequenc filter design base on these test result we are start to construct a practic gto invert for the yamanashi test track as for develop relat to branch equip develop continu on branch equip for high speed and develop is under way on branch equip for the termin and car base in addit the develop is begin on the control system that includ the train drive control oper control and drive mainten system and the inform transmiss system h5 nois h5 maglev railway do not have the unavoid wheel rotat nois and electr collect nois of the pantograph found in wheel and rail system the onli sourc of nois is the nois of air flow around the car thi is a superior featur howev sinc air flow nois is proport to the sixth to eighth power of the speed it becom larg thu not onli convent nois measur center on soundproof wall but measur to specif control nois from the car are requir by implement nois reduct measur like reduc the cross section area of the car remov project from the car smooth the surfac of the car optim the front shape of the car and smooth the surfac of the surfac coil we can expect a 10 db decreas in nois in particular aerodynam optim of the shape of the front section is essenti to nois reduct the front section s shape is not onli import in term of nois but from the perspect of reduc drag henc larg scale wind tunnel test are be perform often the shinkansen nois standard in japan evalu the peak valu of the train dure transit in contrast the nois standard in europ and the unit state use the equival nois level that includ the continu nois period and the number of train similar to airplan car in maglev railway travel are not in contact with anyth when travel in the high speed region therefor the qualiti of the nois differ from that of railroad in addit continu period of nois are extrem short sinc run is at ultra high speed becaus the wecpnl weight equival continu percept nois level which is the airplan nois standard environ agenc notic is tent use in the yamanashi test track as the nois evalu method that is abl to account for the run frequenc of the car the continu time and the time rang 75wecpnl airplan standard type ii compat is adopt h5 energi h5 expert have point out that the reason for the larg power consumpt in the run test at the miyazaki test track is a maglev railway is a transport method with poor energi effici in order to perform high speed test on a short 7 km test track miyazaki test track that requir a maximum 0 3 g acceler and deceler is consid unusu if the railway becom faster energi consumpt will increas in respons to the run resist becaus aerodynam drag is proport to the squar of the speed most of the run resist in the high speed rang is occupi by aerodynam drag as we move toward faster speed in the futur how to decreas the run resist that is aerodynam drag becom a problem therefor use the front shape with the least aerodynam drag and reduc the cross section area of the car are requir but thi come with the drawback of less comfort for the passeng in car with small cross section area and fewer seat in tri to address the desir for faster speed the advantag of faster speed to improv express servic is overcom by the disadvantag of increas energi consumpt caus by the faster speed and decreas live space as a consequ social consensu and market decis by businessmen are probabl need sinc the ground facil for a maglev railway use mani driver and control in the primari ground method the car can be much slimmer than convent car consequ the percentag of a car weight occupi by passeng weight name the payload ratio increas occupi car state 20 0 ton empti car state 15 5 ton in a middl car becaus the system wa construct base on the idea that what doe not have to be move is not move it ha the benefit of energi effici when energi effici in the energi kcal per person s weight in kilogram are compar without regard to speed a domest airport ha a valu of 579 an automobil 527 the tokaido shinkansen 105 while jr maglev s valu is onli 315 h5 magnet h5 there is the impress that a maglev railway gener strong magnet field that harm the human bodi in fact the effect of the magnet field gener by the superconduct magnet on the passeng and on peopl who live along the track is at the same level as the magnet field they normal live in mani electr applianc like electr razor hair dryer televis and wash machin that everyon use have magnet field the magnet field of medic treatment pad 1 300 gauss for stiff shoulder or magnet necklac are also close to the bodi furthermor the whole bodi is expos to a maximum of 20 000 gauss stationari magnet field in magnet reson imag mri equip that is rapidli spread in the medic field to imag tomogram of cours artifici precis devic such as heart pacemak in the bodi and video camera are sensit to magnet field no safeti standard concern magnet field have been establish in japan while there is no proof that magnet field are harm to health exampl standard valu for fluctuat magnet field establish nation in foreign countri are 50 gauss or less at 50 hz in the german industri standard and 20 gauss or less at 100 hz establish by the british radiat protect committe h5 conclus h5 the develop of the maglev railway is enter the stage where effort will center on improv reliabl and reduc cost in the move toward practic use by consid develop and evalu method in other field like automobil and airplan and activ incorpor the develop technolog from each field develop is proceed at a rapid pace a varieti of test are plan for the yamanashi test track as a compil of these technolog develop the result may lead to a deeper understand of most of the technic issu and the final evalu of the maglev railway may becom possibl
