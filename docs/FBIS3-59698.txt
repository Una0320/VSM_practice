interest in fuel cell as urban type on site cogener power sourc and ha been promot their research and develop for long time from the standpoint of protect the global environ and econom resourc sinc 1972 tokyo ga co ltd and osaka ga co ltd have taken part in the target project a u s sponsor develop project of on site fuel cell for gener consum and carri out the test of four pc11 unit each 12 5kw the follow year inaugur the develop of fuel cell in our countri the ga industri later took part in consist r amp d of on site fuel cell in a seri of project includ gri of the unit state the moonlight project of aist nedo and industri project with domest maker thi articl is a report on the develop and field test of on site phosphor acid fuel cell pafc which are steadili near complet h5 2 develop of pafc h5 tabl 1 show the gener outlin of the develop of on site phosphor acid fuel cell h3 2 1 50 kw and 100 kw class model joint develop by three ga compani and fuji electr co ltd h3 the 50 kw model wa made on trial as the first item in the merchandis develop project by three ga compani after the third improv the first trial model for mass product wa perfect in earli 1991 at present 23 unit are oper for evalu test in the facil of four ga compani tokyo ga osaka ga toho ga and saibu ga and in those of custom one model ha alreadi establish the record for longest oper hour 13 000 hr with cumul output of over 500 000kwh wast heat is exclus use for produc hot water 60 deg c the first 100 kw model develop after the 50 kw model start oper in 1992 six unit have been instal in the facil of tokyo ga osaka ga toho ga and other and the longest oper time of 4 000 hour ha been establish unlik the 50 kw type half of the wast heat is recov for the product of steam a combin with the absorpt refriger machin is await to lead to the realiz of a more effici cogener system h5 2 2 200 kw model h5 h3 1 moonlight project for commerci fuel cell nedo osaka ga kansai electr power and mitsubishi electr corp h3 the first model wa instal at the plaza hotel kita ku osaka in juli 1989 and start oper in august of the same year the trial run wa success conclud at the end of octob 1991 with cumul oper time of 13 038 hour the longest record for domest model cell deterior wa also kept within envisag toler h5 2 the first lot unit of pc25 onsi h5 fifti unit of thi quasi commerci model develop by onsi of america are to be distribut around the world from 1992 to 1994 tokyo ga osaka ga and toho ga are purchas in success 10 unit 10 unit and one unit respect field test have continu sinc 1992 in the facil of custom compani nine unit are oper at present with the longest oper time of over 6 000 hour the heat output is exclus use for the product of hot water for the present it is option possibl to produc hot water of 90 deg c for link with an absorpt refriger machin h5 2 3 500 kw model osaka ga and fuji electr h5 the develop of 500 kw model wa start in 1990 and a trial model ha been instal and test at torishima plant of osaka ga distinguish featur of the 500 kw model is that it is target at industri use and region air condit that the steam recoveri ratio ha been rais through low s c and that a fraction unit type packag is adapt for the conveni of transport and instal h5 2 4 1 000 kw model nedo and pafc associ h5 tokyo ga osaka ga toho ga and saibu ga join the phosphor acid fuel cell technolog research associ pafc associ establish in april 1991 and are develop 1 000 kw unit with govern subsidi toshiba corp is entrust with the develop demonstr test are plan in 1995 and 1996 in the tamachi area of tokyo ga h5 3 field test of pafc h5 the ga industri is step up the develop and evalu test of on site fuel cell in prepar for their earli practic applic the ministri of intern trade amp industri inaugur in fy 1992 subsidi for field test of fuel cell power gener system in parallel with solar photovolta power gener system for expedit the introduct and diffus of new power gener system thi project is aim at collect and analysi of variou oper data under the actual condit of fuel cell therebi contribut to their diffus field test of fuel cell are to be conduct from fy 1992 to 1994 in more than 30 categori by subsid one third of the cost involv about yen 600 million wa appropri for thi purpos in the budget of fy 1992 ga compani took part in 15 site of thi project dure fy 1992 in addit they are conduct their own field test in the facil of user among other the field test at umeda center build osaka ha achiev a continu oper time of 4 786 hour and the world record is be renew
