kravchuk well look our economi we are frequent compar with poland the czech republ or slovakia they could do it it is said and we cannot they had their own state their own complet economi zholdak i will tell you whi i am not an economist kravchuk whi zholdak becaus our state ha control of 90 percent of enterpris and kolkhoz let them go kravchuk it is not just that let me now show you some interest data he went over to hi desk and pick up a print sheet of paper with black and white mark kravchuk thi is a privat tabl from an intern magazin look at the privat sector white mark denot 70 percent look at austria more than 70 percent ha been privat there oil and coal the rest belong to the state black mark denot more than 70 percent of the public sector zholdak state own kravchuk public so look there are state in which everyth is in the public sector brazil here is great britain almost everyth is in the public sector in the 11 sector name zholdak is that so kravchuk franc almost everyth in the public sector more than 70 percent what are the sector postal servic telecommun power suppli ga oil coal railway road construct and steamship line here are the main one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 eleven lead sector the public sector zholdak let us look at america kravchuk it ha it own peculiar the level of privat is the highest there zholdak here look everyth is white in america kravchuk not everyth but almost everyth zholdak and what about japan more white mark kravchuk there are more white mark let us take germani you see there are more black mark i am drive all the time at privat not be the onli way out of the situat the main point is for all form of ownership to be equal for equal condit to be creat for all it cannot be that the director of state enterpris would pay wage of 200 000 and a commerci establish next door 2 million condit should be equal for all for all form howev i agre with you that the state cannot carri the weight of the trade sector consum servic small enterpris the garment and light industri agricultur howev there is collect properti too zholdak agricultur is precis what i am veri much interest in it is a fact that the financi and credit system of the countri ha broken down i am say thi and you will object but i will now prove it to you kravchuk i am not say no i am say that it ha broken down zholdak all right the current crop of agricultur product confirm thi look the state ha order these product the state wa suppos to buy them it also promis kolkhoz member resourc on a preferenti basi the state ha now gone bankrupt it ha taken all the grain but ha not paid either the billion or the trillion in a convers with me ivan stepanovych confirm that these are trillion and the state is not pay back thi is the question for you leonid makarovych kravchuk whi not pay back it is pay zholdak mere drop it is not pay back kravchuk it is the state is pay back albeit with difficulti and will pay back a differ system for relat between the state and the agrarian sector ha been approv for 1994 it is suppos to ensur a new approach in order to somehow resolv these acut problem gradual zholdak mr presid academician ihor yukhnovskyy who is also the polit comment of ukrayinska hazeta ha propos to lay tax in kind on farm he ha inform you in thi case the state will have an abund of foodstuff without spend money just for tax in kind for exampl i oper my own farm and i am suppos to give the state one third of the crop depend on the qualiti of land what is your view of thi kravchuk well thi should be calcul thi idea of ihor rafayilovych should be work on zholdak a farm could give the state a certain establish proport of grain or meat per hectar it would be interest in increas the output of product becaus a fix unchang tax would be establish the greater the crop grown by peasant the more they get to keep thi is advantag to all kravchuk howev thi is natur economi rather than the market thi should be calcul properli zholdak so you approv of thi idea kravchuk as an idea that should be studi well an expert analysi of which should be made zholdak leonid makarovych thi is a pain question how are we to get rid of specul at everi step we take can we realli not give minist of intern affair andriy vasylyshyn the right to at least scare these middlemen in the time of the communist era there wa never such rapac and fraud on our street and squar next to railway termin as we have now those who tri to resel merchandis from store were put behind bar right away now thi is free big busi if onli they were peddl their own product kravchuk previous if they caught someon they did not look at the law they caught them and put them in prison right away zholdak and whi do vasylyshyn s peopl not do it thi way now kravchuk everybodi must act in keep with the law and there should be good law zholdak the law is what it is but if a store salesman pass for exampl deterg to hi peopl through the back door and these good are sold at four to five time their price is thi not a crime kravchuk can you prove it zholdak next to the ukrain depart store in kiev close to the stop of street car no 1 plump women sell one packag at 13 000 14 000 in the shop thi merchandis cost 3 000 but it is not avail it is simpl to prove that the street peddler did not manufactur the deterg powder herself kravchuk she will say i bought it and now i do not need it and you do not have to buy it there should be normal provis and arrang for their applic although the law enforc organ are not do everyth by far there are also other problem of democraci for exampl you bought a product in anoth countri and brought it in for sale you set a price those who want it buy it and those who do not do not thi is your right how is thi specul thi should not be put simpli and primit if i am sell thi amount to specul i agre with you on someth els if you buy someth in a store and then go out and sell it right away i am against it howev thi should be translat into law if you follow close the meet of the coordin council for combat organ crime minist vasylyshyn and hi guy are alreadi do noth but thi in order to cleans our street and squar in front of railway termin from impud middlemen there is one more point if econom condit are not creat you will first establish control over yourself and over the one who control and thi chain may go on to the point of absurd becaus nobodi ha yet defeat either specul or other crimin affair by administr legal control alon zholdak well thi did not happen dure the communist era comrad former secretari of the communist parti of ukrain central committe i maintain thi as a former member of the cpsu kravchuk there wa anoth system a system of a totalitarian regim pressur and lawless were the foundat of polit zholdak is anyth at all allow now kravchuk no zholdak nonetheless how are we to find bear for the peopl so that they will live honestli and happili kravchuk there is a way out we should make a transit to such live condit that it will no longer be advantag for peopl to resel zholdak it will not be advantag when everyth that we need appear in store kravchuk thi is what it is about i know from your write that you have been to pari tell me did you see specul on the street and squar over there or did you see these shack and stand with which the oblast seat especi kiev are strewn zholdak pari and kiev are not in the same leagu kravchuk it will also be like thi here ukrain will definit becom as rich as say franc time is need the skill of econom manag of our peopl is still the main point i have met with the former presid of turkey ozal he told me the follow stori well our flock of sheep were driven to iran all the time we could not do anyth we set up border brought in the polic imprison the guilti execut and so on noth work howev what did we do later we increas price for our wool and hide price becam higher than in iran the sheep began to come over to us from there onli econom instrument may realli influenc our situat you see there are 52 million peopl and each of them want to find hi nich in life includ an econom nich thi is whi it is imposs for gener vasylyshyn to assign a control to everyon zholdak it is so leonid makarovych howev when i see thi abomin specul in the street they even resel polit cigarett my heart bleed for the honest peopl who are be fleec in thi ungodli manner they make million in one or two day may your heart bleed we should fight such evil resolut after all kravchuk not onli my heart bleed i do not want my heart to bleed zholdak i am say thi figur kravchuk i understand i want real work to be done what we are now do togeth with minist vasylyshyn and head of the sbu secur servic of ukrain marchuk is real and we do
