languag f p 105 chines f articl type cso f p 106 articl by yin lian 1438 3550 senior engin ministri f of electr power industri beij statut issu countermeasur an assess of china s new energi resourc strategi and a discuss of countermeasur text editor s note we cannot just sit idli by look at the varieti of action that all countri of the world have taken to develop new energi resourc and the strateg trend they have reveal they show us that a larg energi consum nation that basic ha a singl energi resourc structur compos of coal must take notic of the prospect and signific of the new energi resourc of the 21st centuri from the perspect of strateg transit and must start earli in make the correspond polici decis and deploy for thi reason we have ask some expert and scholar to conduct a discuss we are now publish the main point of repres speech given at the symposium to attract the attent of reader in all area h3 i the statu of develop new energi resourc in our overal nation econom situat h3 i bring up thi issu becaus veri few peopl have mention new energi resourc in the process of acceler the develop of china s nation economi on the one hand peopl not in the energi resourc trench do not understand new energi resourc veri well while on the other hand peopl in these trench feel that new energi resourc do not requir the solut of major problem a failur to resolv thi problem of understand may caus china s new energi resourc industri to miss the favor opportun of the present time slow our progress in develop new energi resourc and therebi affect china s futur energi resourc strategi of the 21st centuri therefor it is necessari that i summar here the import statu and role of new energi resourc in the develop of our nation economi concept that the chines peopl do not understand clearli and that peopl have not yet accept new energi resourc is the gener name use intern for solar power wind energi marin energi geotherm energi biomass energi and fuel cell becaus solar power wind energi marin energi geotherm energi and biomass energi are character by be renew they are call renew energi resourc at present new energi resourc are energi resourc that mankind util in a transit to a new state and they have been receiv grow attent sinc the petroleum crisi of the 1970 the technolog for their applic ha been develop quickli and they are move toward greater matur and the achiev of commerci so that new energi resourc are form forc of product in energi resourc system and occupi a first class statu in the energi resourc structur for the past sever year mani author in energi resourc and econom have explain in scientif technic econom and polit term that while the 20th centuri wa the petroleum and hydrocarbon era major chang will occur dure the 21st centuri becaus of the effect of scientif and technolog develop and breakthrough restrict by the global environ the need for sustain social develop econom and polit factor and so on mankind is now start to enter the era of renew energi resourc at present the total amount of energi resourc consum each year global is onli equival to the amount of energi irradi onto the earth s surfac from the sun in 40 minut which mean that solar energi is 13 000 time the amount of energi consum in the world solar power is energi that caus absolut no pollut and all renew energi resourc includ solar energi wind power water energi biomass energi and so on come from solar energi in the next centuri as we face the dual crise of convent fuel becom exhaust and the environment pollut they caus new energi resourc will develop further thu energi and econom expert and author with long term view are call for the entir world to take action in a major effort to develop and util new energi resourc china is a big produc and consum of energi resourc and coal domin our energi resourc util account for about 75 percent of primari energi resourc within the forese futur coal will continu to be china s main energi resourc china s coal output may reach 1 4 billion ton in 2000 as our economi quickli grow china s energi resourc structur in which coal is the primari factor will face two big problem one is the extrem uneven geograph distribut of our coal resourc and the ever grow pressur on transport some 79 8 percent of china s current proven coal reserv are concentr in north and northwest china and most other region reli mainli on railway transport for the coal they use a substanti portion of china s railway transport capac is use to haul coal which ha result in long term shortag of railway transport capac that have been hard to chang the second problem is the increasingli seriou atmospher pollut and ecolog destruct that result from burn larg amount of coal which ha attract attent in china and foreign countri china now gener about 15 million ton of carbon dioxid annual and is one of the largest sourc of co sup 2 in the world moreov becaus of the effect geograph restrict decentr and fluctuat load the economi and other factor china still ha sever region that will face difficulti in ensur suppli of convent energi resourc for a rel long period these problem will vex china s energi resourc industri and even develop of our nation economi for a period into the futur how can we resolv them in the long term one feasibl method is to formul and implement a develop strategi for the diversif of our energi resourc structur in a major effort to develop new energi resourc renew energi resourc in realiti china s energi resourc are character by a divers resourc structur besid have extrem abund coal petroleum and natur ga miner energi resourc we are also veri well endow with renew energi resourc moreov our renew energi resourc and miner energi resourc are also gener character by be mutual supplementari in the geograph distribut of all type of energi resourc dure the past 10 plu year under guidanc by the overal polici of adapt to local condit supplement by a varieti of energi resourc comprehens util and a concern for real result new energi resourc applic technolog ha move from the scientif research stage to the applic stage and some new energi resourc technolog are capabl of compet local with miner fuel applic technolog thi is especi true of the role they have play in spur econom develop and social stabil in the basic energi resourc requir of peasant and pastoralist in frontier pastor and island region practic ha proven that new energi resourc are energi resourc with long term prospect and short term benefit activ and ration develop new energi resourc is not someth that we can take or leav in the develop of our nation economi instead it is directli relat to the develop of china s energi resourc and environment improv and therebi affect the develop of our entir nation economi develop and util of new energi resourc is an object necess to meet thi type of need still in the current period of energi resourc depart compet to take the plung into busi activ and move toward the market if they are onli concern with short term benefit and onli take into account present day requir by neglect construct and develop of new energi resourc and demot new energi resourc by onli treat them as small scale energi resourc they will certainli miss an histor opportun for rapid develop of new energi resourc and endang the new trend of a major transit major transform and major competit of china s new energi resourc compet against the world s energi resourc and their statu in the new configur which will in turn endang china s futur comprehens strength and develop potenti and reserv strength h5 ii issu and idea in the new energi resourc field h5 h5 a the matur of new energi resourc technic econom h5 the develop of new energi resourc applic technolog pose challeng for tradit electr power suppli concept becaus of scientif and technic progress chang in the energi resourc structur and the need to protect the environ conserv energi resourc and improv energi resourc effici the tradit central and unifi power suppli arrang of larg grid and larg gener will be challeng by applic of new energi resourc technolog and by decentr and local balanc small scale power gener equip and energi storag facil for over 100 year the tradit arrang of larg grid larg gener and central power suppli ha alway been consid to be the safest and most econom power suppli arrang howev becaus construct and develop of larg grid and larg gener are restrict by a varieti of condit and becaus of the great difficulti in guarante the safeti and reliabl of power suppli decentr power suppli arrang call distribut util in the unit state are continu to display their superior and vital under the guidanc of thi idea new energi resourc develop and applic technolog ha move toward commerci and now attain appli level that enabl them to oper in connect with larg power grid while also be capabl of independ suppli electr in a decentr manner as for the develop and applic of new energi resourc themselv intern and domest practic ha proven that the technic econom prospect of new energi resourc are determin by their abil to compet with convent energi resourc the focu of competit is on power gener technolog for new energi resourc to convert new energi resourc into an econom competit high grade secondari energi resourc electr intern new energi resourc circl in the 1960 at the time when power wa gener from new energi resourc onli propos small scale equip measur in watt in the 1970 the discuss wa of equip of sever kilowatt thi rose in the 1980 to sever ten of kilowatt as the 1990 began howev peopl were oper appli system of the mw grade one can see that the speed of new energi resourc develop ha far surpass peopl s imagin the cost of most new energi resourc applic project have declin over the year and the construct cost for solar thermal energi power station photovolta power station wind power gener field and geotherm power station have now declin to 1 000 to 1 500 per kw and power gener cost to 0 07 to 0 08 per kwh project are that the power gener cost use new energi resourc will drop to about 0 04 per kwh by the year 2000 regard power gener technolog new energi resourc power gener technolog ha just gotten off the ground in china and the problem we must resolv includ the need to improv the qualiti of miniatur wind power gener and the need to rais standard and system level and further reduc cost the need to import and absorb technolog from foreign countri for the design and manufactur of medium size and larg gener that can be connect to grid to form a substanti batch product capac on a domest foundat and to establish sever larg and medium size wind energi power gener field that display technic benefit function and improv relat to the substanti lag of china s present photovolta batteri behind foreign countri in qualiti and effici in addit we must diversifi and appli the associ match appli technolog we must central special staff and regular start point for solar thermal energi power gener geotherm power gener urgent requir the develop of high temperatur mine survey technolog and scientif research on refil and heat storag technolog the manufactur technolog for the tidal energi full through flow water turbin gener that we have alreadi success develop requir improv the develop of biomass energi resourc must develop toward high grade and therebi toward power gener solidif carbon and gasif technolog china s new energi resourc develop technolog face mani import issu and ha mani object we must gradual increas invest to solv problem in scientif and engin applic in econom term new energi resourc power gener technolog is a new forc of product in the electr power industri and it applic is still in the initi stage the econom problem it face are in the state s present econom structur and price system the benefit from new energi resourc in the short term will still mainli be social benefit and environment and ecolog benefit and their econom benefit will not be that signific in china the capit now use for develop and util of new energi resourc hold no statu to speak of in the overal invest in energi resourc and it is veri difficult to undertak more intens comprehens and systemat research becaus of serious inadequ expenditur and too small project scale it is veri hard for demonstr and applic engin project to achiev their object of display technic econom benefit and guid market develop prospect h3 b the impact of reform of the energi resourc system on new energi resourc develop h3 for a long time to come energi resourc will still be the key restrict factor for china s nation econom and social develop as well as the focu for revers ecolog and environment degrad howev in a worldwid comparison our acknowledg and understand of the role and statu of new energi resourc is still veri poor under the heavi pressur of seriou stagnat in system reform in energi resourc depart acceler econom develop and seriou shortag of energi resourc it is even harder for them to receiv the attent that they should in the process of shift track from the tradit plan economi new energi resourc are face a two side pincer attack from the tradit plan economi and the market on develop of the new energi resourc industri the tradit plan economi ha occupi the primari statu in energi resourc depart for a long time and the product alloc and util of energi resourc are manag too much and too close with low effici a seriou detach of price and the trade system from the actual market department segment friction from regul and region closur that imped market develop as well as macro coordin in thi type of situat it is hard to make quick readjust in program invest price and taxat to extend new energi resourc applic technolog and provid preferenti measur furthermor under condit of incomplet market oper mechan the unfavor circumst for the newli born new energi resourc industri are obviou h3 c the impact of energi resourc develop strategi on new energi resourc h3 china ha a rel insuffici of energi resourc with per capita energi resourc reserv that are just one half the world averag moreov nearli all are in a unitari energi resourc structur in which coal is the domin factor becaus of long term low price plunder exploit and extens consumpt the overal effici of the energi resourc system is extrem low so we must use comprehens reform of the econom system to truli chang the extens develop model of reli on the squander of preciou energi resourc to support low result econom growth thi mean that we must place improv of the ultim effici of energi resourc in the primari posit and truli and comprehens implement a major energi conserv principl while we are comprehens implement major energi conserv measur and increas energi suppli we must have a broad and long term view look toward the futur and make major effort to readjust the energi resourc structur acceler the pace of new energi resourc develop reduc the extract of fossil fuel rais the strateg statu of new energi resourc and strive to make new energi resourc account for a signific proport of china s energi resourc structur by the year 2000 moreov we must lay a solid foundat for acceler develop of commerci applic of new energi resourc s amp t in the next centuri and therebi resolv the limit of fossil fuel and foster the renew of new energi resourc increas the product of new energi resourc to reduc discharg and pollut from co sup 2 so sub 2 no sub x and dust from convent fossil fuel and lessen the threat of acid rain and it neg impact on nearbi countri and the global environ thi will also greatli benefit china s reduct of invest in technic upgrad to prevent pollut from convent energi resourc and improv overal invest result we must adopt the energi resourc strategi and principl outlin abov to be abl to formul energi resourc develop plan that conform to our nation condit and that are capabl of long term strateg action and therebi achiev sustain and coordin develop of china s popul energi resourc environ and economi otherwis an energi resourc structur that fundament reli on coal will ultim pull us into a disastr situat h5 d the goal model for reform h5 it is precis due to all type of profound idea that new energi resourc circl worldwid have propos the slogan of think global act local the member nation of the intern energi agenc iea are set asid 7 percent of their financi budget for use in new energi resourc r amp d and author are call for all nation to place the work of develop and util new energi resourc in the primari posit to adapt to the need of the energi resourc system of the 21st centuri as a develop nation china is a countri with a larg demand for energi resourc as well as a major energi resourc pollut so dure the process of econom reform and develop we must formul clear strategi and countermeasur concern the question of new energi resourc and we must formul the correspond goal model for readjust transform and transit in our energi resourc structur to be abl to catch up with the enorm chang that will occur worldwid 1 dure the period of move from a plan economi toward a market economi system develop of new energi resourc must adher to the principl of link plan with the market and the develop of new energi resourc must mainli involv their convers into electr so that new energi resourc becom direct forc of product factor to meet market demand initi commerci new energi resourc technolog can onli foster it advantag of integr plan with the market and make use of a relax polici environ to be abl to seiz the opportun for new energi resourc acceler their develop and creat the condit for china s new energi resourc to enter self reliant and market orient benevol develop in the 21st centuri 2 in the long term the new energi resourc industri is a new forc of product in that industri and the new energi resourc industri must boldli enter the market to develop itself and take a new rout for the develop of china s energi resourc industri through activ util the market economi system such as rais capit through a varieti of channel implement a sharehold system and sharehold cooper system and adopt an arrang of joint administr for mutual benefit in manag as for the govern s macro manag it should creat a benevol environ for the develop of new energi resourc adopt intern accept method and provid all type of polici support for new energi resourc invest such as tax reduct and exempt preferenti price and so on to propel new energi resourc into the market reli on themselv to develop and exist and grow and therebi spur the comprehens movement of china s new energi resourc onto the track of intern level in term of scienc and technolog develop and manag econom benefit and other area h3 e rais our nation conscious regard new energi resourc h3 it is now extrem evid that the develop and util of new energi resourc is an histor mileston in mankind s social develop and scientif progress and that a conscious regard improv of our entir nation s develop and util of new energi resourc ha now becom an extrem import epoch task we must with impetu and attract conduct regular and broad rang propaganda we must make peopl at all level as well as the mass understand the signific and role of new energi resourc in term of the fundament statu of energi resourc and their impact and role on the economi and environ so that we spur the formul of a state new energi resourc develop law and use legisl to guarante the sustain develop of new energi resourc transform the current manag state of bullish and lack of procedur regard new energi resourc and with an overal program and goal model reli on a multi direct and multipl level market while also reli on polici to support the develop of new energi resourc thi is essenti if china in the 21st centuri is to be abl to particip in global joint develop on a foundat of comprehens and healthi develop of s amp t societi and the economi
