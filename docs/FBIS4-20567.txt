cso f p 106 articl by a kishi mazda technic research center f yokohama text h5 1 introduct h5 as the econom recess continu a social re examin seem to be take place with regard to give consum the kind of product and servic that they realli want i believ that in time such as thi there is more of a demand for authent product and technolog what i mean here by authent is provid a basic valu for good purchas that give the averag custom a sens of satisfact to meet these need requir matur technolog that show an understand of the consum and what they want the matur technolog refer to here are consum technolog that essenti solv the problem that peopl consid import to them for that reason i think that we are enter a time in which research institut that have stockpil mani differ technolog will be ask to lead the way therefor in thi paper i would like to introduc the mazda technic research center and in do so discuss what it is do to address these new social trend h5 2 research center profil h5 the first technic research center that mazda establish to concentr on new technolog wa in 1985 at it headquart in hiroshima and then in 1987 it ad the yokohama technic research center in yokohama the basic idea behind open the technic research center here in yokohama wa to use the slogan at the time build an automobil cultur what thi mean is not treat the car simpli as a mean of travel but treat it as one of the essenti element of societi and cultur that peopl need when the research center initi receiv word of thi new slogan the research center at mazda headquart in hiroshima decid to put it emphasi on new technolog that were directli relat to the develop of car type wherea the research center in yokohama decid it would focu on basic technolog in advanc field orient toward automobil technolog of the 21st centuri at present the two research center are exchang idea and deepen tie with one anoth base on respect area of expertis and are steadili play more import role as the core place within mazda for develop new technolog next befor we get into specif research activ i would like to discuss my own view regard research h5 3 person view regard research h5 research institut are at the pinnacl of research and develop and have an import mission in develop and explor consum technolog for that reason i feel that research institut have to reflect the long term and medium term need of consum in their research with that in mind i would like to take the opportun here to state the direct i believ that consum trend are go until now compani have stress high valu ad car that offer more in the way of divers perform and function in the futur howev there will probabl be a shift from superfici enjoy need to more basic enjoy need the need for exampl to maintain respect for human life whether one s own or other is grow ever more stronger in term of both product safeti and the environ for exampl someth ha to be done about the more than 10 000 peopl a year that die in auto accid and the other problem that exist such as environment pollut caus by carbon dioxid and nitrou oxid and also find other energi altern to petroleum these problem are an immedi and futur threat to ourselv our famili and our children and are caus for concern these are essenti problem that have to do with the car itself so if we are to resolv these issu we must steadili stockpil those technolog with an eye toward the futur with that said i would now like to introduc some area of research to show the work we are do in tackl some of these problem h5 4 research activ outlin h5 in thi section i have divid the research activ into environ friendli and peopl friendli research and focus in on particular research project in each area from the perspect discuss abov of address the basic need of today s consum h5 4 1 environ friendli technolog h5 what we mean here by environ friendli technolog are those technolog for solv the environment and energi resourc problem we are like to face in the 21st centuri more specif it mean those technolog concern with develop energi altern to petroleum and those technolog concern with recycl that tri to limit exhaust ga emiss by research new combust method for reduc carbon dioxid and nitrou oxid emiss and make effect use of resourc 1 technolog for develop energi substitut i would like to start by talk about the hydrogen rotari engin automobil hr x thi car wa develop to convey the imag of an urban type commut car to be use in a 21st centuri environ restor with light and greeneri figur 1 figur not reproduc is a photograph of the hr x car a hydrogen rotari engin is a clean engin that burn hydrogen and is revolutionari in the sens that it doe not emit carbon dioxid nor destroy natur cycl more recent we develop a prototyp model of that car outfit with a hydrogen fuel cell and success test drove it for the first time figur 2 figur not reproduc is a photograph of the hydrogen fuel cell car thi car enabl us to clarifi a number of technic issu have to do with outfit a car such as thi and took us one step closer toward achiev the goal of a futur societi base on hydrogen fuel car h5 2 technolog for control exhaust ga emiss h5 in term of research on engin we are research the composit of fuel mixtur and combust mechan use a varieti of method includ both visual and comput base in tri to chang the flame propag process we have been do research on a peripher combust process that caus the spark ignit to occur from the peripheri of the cylind use thi techniqu we were abl to reduc nitrou oxid emiss dramat and bring about a major improv in lean burn combust that research receiv the asahara academ achiev award at the 42nd japan societi of automot engin confer h5 3 recycl technolog h5 we are also do research on materi in term of recycl which includ both metal and plastic and in so do have develop a recycl plastic composit made of a plastic fiber reinforc liquid crystal polym we now have the abil to recycl plastic composit that were onc virtual imposs to recycl and are abl to make more effect use of our resourc h5 4 2 peopl friendli technolog h5 what we mean here by peopl friendli technolog are those technolog concern with understand the need of the driver and passeng and those concern with improv safeti in order to make the automobil societi we live in more enjoy and troubl free 1 prevent safeti we are involv in a number of research project on advanc technolog concern with prevent accid one of these involv a safe drive support system and anoth a road traffic commun system the safe drive support system is a system that act as a back up in case of driver error and the commun system is a system for provid driver with safeti inform about the road for exampl in the safe drive support system project we are do research on automat brake and a white line recognit method in figur 3 figur not reproduc we show the test car we are use in our research on white line recognit by imag process mount in the trunk of the car is a high speed comput program to recogn road featur 2 human technolog we are also make headway in research on a driver simul in order to elucid the drive psycholog and behavior characterist of driver in figur 4 we show a gener draw of the drive simul with a driver on board the drive simul is expect to be use as a tool for elucid caus of auto accid and also as a tool for research drive characterist of beginn and older driver fig id jpr jst 014l 29a figur 4 gener draw of drive simul fig we have also been do research on way to evalu driver alert by measur brain wave so that we can take those habit into account when design the insid of the car so as to make it harder for the driver to fall asleep figur 5 figur not reproduc show an experi be conduct to ascertain the relationship between brain wave signal and delay respons in human due to decreas alert person be test in photograph is author of articl there are a lot of central function in the human brain that remain unknown i think that by creat an understand of driver characterist such as recognit alert and fatigu by studi brain activ that we can offer new consum technolog for improv safeti h5 5 conclus h5 in the forego we profil the entir research center and discuss some individu research project i think that the key to provid consum with what they want in term of basic valu are the technolog that we have been busi stockpil in introduc the research center from thi perspect we want to thank the mani technic engin and research special in automobil technolog for their help in shed some light on the research project be carri out within the center
