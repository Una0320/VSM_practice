worldwid petroleum crisi in the 1970 that spur the rapid develop of new energi resourc and renew energi resourc in the develop countri the subsequ resolut of that crisi and fall petroleum price have onc again slow the develop momentum of new energi resourc and renew energi resourc dure the past sever year mankind ha come to understand that fossil energi resourc reserv are limit and that pollut from fossil energi resourc ha obvious destroy the equilibrium between global space and the overal ecolog on which mankind depend for it exist and that non pollut new energi resourc and renew energi resourc are truli energi resourc on which it can reli wind energi is a clean and renew inexhaust energi resourc through more than 10 year of research and develop the technolog is matur and the econom and social benefit are appar the price of wind gener electr in the unit state is 0 06 to 0 07 per kwh and will drop to 0 04 by the year 2000 as a result the develop countri are compet to develop it and are invest larg amount of capit formul sever medium and long term develop program and establish all type of organ to conduct r amp d such as denmark s lisuo wind power gener experi station the unit state wind energi associ the japan wind energi associ the european wind energi assoc etc at the same time all countri are compet to formul the associ polici such as provid tax exempt for privat capit invest in wind energi in the unit state and requir that electr power compani purchas wind gener electr from wind power gener field and the implement of a one third subsidi from the state in denmark for privat purchas of wind power gener and permit the sale of electr to electr power compani wind energi develop and util in china ha alway been a concern of the state and sever key wind energi project were includ among project to attack key s amp t problem dure the sixth 5 year plan seventh 5 year plan and eighth 5 year plan china ha now establish an s amp t and product staff of more than 3 000 peopl and we have establish sever 10 product plant produc small scale and larg and medium size wind power machineri with an annual small scale wind power gener product capac of 30 000 unit and develop and product of 55 kw 120 kw and 200 kw wind power gener is now in progress china as a whole ha now extend 120 000 small wind power gener and we have nine medium size and small wind power gener field under construct china s wind power instal gener capac is now more than 20mw as part of it inner mongolia and xinjiang have made enorm contribut to small wind power gener and larg wind power gener demonstr extens and applic china s wind energi develop and util can be divid overal into four phase phase 1 involv the develop of small 10 kw and smaller wind power gener phase 2 involv the commerci batch product and extens of small wind power gener phase 3 involv the develop of medium size 10 kw to 100 kw wind power gener the present phase 4 involv batch product of medium size wind power gener and the develop of larg 100 kw and up wind power gener the commerci wind power gener that china is now capabl of produc in batch amount are 100 w 150 w 200 w 250 w 300 w 500 w 1 kw 3 kw 5 kw 20 kw 30 kw 40 kw 55 kw and 120 kw gener china will be capabl of small batch product of the 200 kw wind power gener it develop around the end of 1995 to improv the situat of use foreign made gener in our nine wind power gener field in inner mongolia xinjiang liaon guangdong fujian shandong zhejiang and other locat moreov china ha develop it own eight varieti of wind power water rais machineri with a maximum flow rate of up to 120 to 200 ton per hour and a maximum lift height of 140 meter and the perform of certain devic ha now attain intern level applic of china s wind power water rais machineri have alreadi produc rather good econom result for exampl use fdg 7 wind power water lifter for two stage water rais in salt field can conserv over 10 000 kwh of electr annual for a save of about 6 000 yuan wind power water lift machineri use in the tianjin region ha produc veri good econom result in desalin of veget field and they are now make major effort to extend them china is a develop countri with a larg popul vast territori and shortag of energi resourc the develop of new energi resourc is a strateg shift for energi resourc and can produc real benefit given china s technic capabl develop wind energi is certainli not someth that cannot be attain china s famou scientist qian xueseng 6929 1331 2773 wrote to the china wind energi technolog develop center in 1991 describ the world s major effort at present to develop wind energi and china s broad prospect for wind energi develop and say that we must develop them in a major way instead of just piddl around in june 1991 at the wind energi construct plan confer held by the ministri of energi resourc minist huang yicheng 7806 3015 6134 point out that develop wind energi requir that we foster everyon s initi and that we get organ improv our understand of use wind power to gener electr and focu on wind power electr gener as one forc in overal electr power construct accord to preliminari plan by the ministri of energi resourc we will strive for an increas of 120 to 200mw a year to achiev thi object given china s exist wind energi technic forc we should take the rout of self develop which mean organ china s wind energi expert on our exist technic foundat in a plan manner absorb the essenc of advanc gener from foreign countri develop larg gener that conform to china s nation condit and engag in cooper as appropri with foreign busi that are will to provid technolog as well as expand the proport of domest manufactur compon and attain a complet shift to domest product in the long term some of our product should satisfi domest demand and some of them should be export to develop countri to attain a foreign exchang balanc in the entir process we must watch out that all depart do not engag in blind import without conduct econom analysi the state scienc and technolog commiss and other ministri and commiss should control import and except in case that have state permiss we should focu on protect our own nascent industri and the state scienc and technolog commiss should increas it invest in wind energi r amp d the state econom and trade commiss should increas it invest in the wind power machineri industri and strive to attain a domest product rate of 80 percent for the wind power gener in china s wind power gener field by 2000 to chang the present lopsid develop situat current the intern price of larg wind power gener is about 900 to 1 000 per kw wherea the price of small domest hydropow gener is 3 000 yuan renminbi per kw so when they are be produc in larg batch the price of china s larg wind power gener could be 4 000 to 5 000 yuan renminbi and each kwh of electr about 0 04 yuan larg scale develop of wind energi would be best among new energi resourc so it would be entir capabl of compet with thermal power in region that have electr power shortag wind power electr on nan ao guangdong ha been welcom by the local electr power bureau and the nan ao island electr power compani can sustain it exist now by sell electr gener by wind power thu we can affirm that with the state s guidanc the develop of wind energi will produc real benefit
