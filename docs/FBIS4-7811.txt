smuggler have appear in macedonia i e everyth that embellish a classic mafia h5 the mafia is in the govern or h5 there is organ crime in macedonia and that ha to be said openli for onc said pavl trajanov assist minist for oper affair in the ministri of intern affair what is signific in all thi in hi opinion is that organ crime ha slowli begun to penetr the state s execut branch sinc crimin conduct in an organ manner is not possibl unless the author particip in it or in our case individu ministri of the govern of the republ of macedonia as our interlocutor emphas there are sever evid case of machin under the leadership of state bodi one of the most characterist case is the process of obtain a locat for the construct of a temporari or perman build the ministri of citi plan construct transport and ecolog particip in issu the build permit and the ministri of economi for a permit to conduct busi and to these one must add the ministri of financ through the tax inspector and the sok public audit servic in thi whole chain where numer abus have appear as trajanov said it is imposs that some of the institut cite are not involv the case of import product is even more specif we have analys for three year back of which firm receiv import permit and which amount they import trajanov said from which it can be clearli seen that all these thing revolv around a small number of enterpris which receiv import permit and then simpli sell them to anoth firm and natur in the end the money is share with the one that provid the permit in other word the one who is closer to the author through ani type of close gain a privileg statu for earn a profit thu there are no built in criteria for all those who have an interest in import instead protectionist measur are creat through which onli a narrow circl of firm are patron i can state quit authorit that the execut branch bodi are behind all of thi trajanov said categor thi highli organ crime ha been go on for two year and high offici in both the product enterpris and the govern are particip in it accord to the assist minist of intern affair it is not possibl for what is produc and what is market not to be record without the involv of some govern ministri sinc the net profit from just one truckload of cigarett is about 300 000 german mark dm the basic methodolog of organ crime is briberi and corrupt accord to our interlocutor these mode are conduct today in a veri perfidi manner we have a great deal of inform he emphas that state offici even govern minist have privat firm usual in the name of a close rel through which organ crime take place how the method is veri simpl first a permit is obtain for the transit or import of certain good into macedonia and then the trade in the good is conduct through one s own firm formal everyth is within the law pavl trajanov said but the genesi is in the ordinari abus of one s posit nevertheless as our interlocutor emphas the most modern form of organ crime is act as a middleman in other word those who are a factor in decisionmak onli act as middlemen among two or more firm and receiv a commiss in return for exampl if there is an offer from some foreign firm for instanc for export technic equip need by a certain ministri or other state institut then the middleman appear and put the foreign firm in touch with the domest one and charg a commiss for thi thi trajanov said constitut a textbook case of corrupt h5 the govern is in the mafia h5 as polic our hand are tie by sever thing that keep us from deal with organ crime effici pavl trajanov said in hi opinion it is imposs for the polic without cooper with other supervisori bodi in the state to act on their own in thi area and likewis anoth big problem is the still incomplet legal regul defin certain relationship in the state which at the moment are activ be exploit by organ crime our limit our interlocutor emphas is the constitut barrier accord to which onli letter can be monitor while the monitor of telephon and other mean of commun is not permit if thi doe not chang in a short time and the use of these oper technic mean that would be use under strictli establish legal condit and by a decis by a compet judg is not permit we will onli obtain inform that we will be abl to comment on but it will be much more difficult for us to obtain evid without which crimin proceed cannot be start trajanov state categor now there are alreadi variou indic inform and abov all fact show that organ crime exist in macedonia and that abov all the state institut of the execut branch are involv in it all of thi trajanov emphas doe not forc us as the polic to restructur ourselv organiz it is plan that a special section will be form soon at the ministri of intern affair that will deal exclus with curb organ crime and that will possess all the necessari condit for effect oper that abov all mean it staf and profession of it oper as well as provid it with appropri technic equip i want to emphas trajanov said that the ministri of intern affair is serious prepar and is alreadi consider involv in all these matter associ with organ crime the ministri of intern affair he ad possess an extens bodi of inform and it is known quit well who is involv in these illeg activ how and whi includ individu who at the moment are in high govern posit h5 parallel rule by organ crime h5 collect organ crime constitut one of the form of profession crime which is character by a close allianc between profession crimin and law enforc offici said dr tome batkovski a lectur at the secur school in

politician profession crimin connect with govern offici batkovski emphas give repres of organ crime an enorm advantag over other crimin precis becaus of that protect that they have there is actual a tremend threat to the human right of a larg part of the popul just becaus the center of power goe outsid the framework of the legal institut the crimin area of activ of collect organ crime consist of

the illeg associ whose activ in practic is organ crime are the follow abov all intern organ structur the exist of intern standard of conduct with disciplin in carri out assign a divis of duti a broad radiu of activ high effect with the use of modern method a high degre of maneuver and go beyond the nation framework final accord to batkovski one of the most fundament characterist of organ crime is the brutal of it approach i e a lack of scrupl and it basic method is corrupt and directli associ with it blackmail threat and retali organ crime repres a tremend social danger abov all becaus it introduc disorgan in the state destroy the legal fabric of societi instil distrust among the legal state bodi and in the case of smaller state there is a danger of parallel rule by organ crime which can have unforese consequ for undevelop countri includ macedonia accord to dr batkovski the extent of the power of thi form of crime is best illustr by the case of the colombian cocain mafia which offer to repay part of thi countri s foreign debt in the amount of believ it or not 28 billion in return the colombian govern wa suppos to refus to extradit the captur head of the drug mafia to the unit state dr batkovski stress that thi is a vital exampl of the enorm power of organ crime we are talk about an extrem seriou matter and i think that the struggl against thi organ crime ha to be an integr part of a nation strategi in the broader sens our interlocutor emphas without that through palli and partial solut noth can be achiev tome batkovski said in conclus h5 box p 16 h5 h5 batkovski organ crime should not be underestim h5 if we are talk about the struggl against organ crime we should note onc again that it possess enorm power and influenc it is precis for that reason that it is alway one step ahead of societi in the use of modern method and resourc that mean that in curb it the state s expert bodi and servic have to keep up to date and stay in step with the method and resourc use by repres of organ crime from the standpoint of it organ modern oper servic have to be creat that will be capabl of maneuv quickli and adapt to organ crime s method and resourc but on the other hand that requir a societ guarante to the employe of these servic not just by ensur the safeti of their famili but also in their salari sinc it is an illus that an employe with a salari of dm300 or dm400 will object be capabl of deal with illeg activ in which hundr of thousand or million of german mark are involv h5 box p 16 h5 h5 trajanov some polit parti are also financ by dirti h5 deal i can authorit state that the mafia in macedonia is assum an increasingli larger scale and is threaten to grow into a parallel state govern likewis i stand behind the assert that numer peopl in author are also involv in organ crime in our countri especi in the macedonian govern s ministri those who are now enrich themselv thi way will slowli and sure achiev influenc in polit life as well we alreadi possess inform that certain polit parti are be financ by such dirti deal and busi in other word someon who invest in a certain polit parti will subsequ demand compens i e greater polit influenc and particip in the divis of power in the countri all the precondit now exist for a high degre of corros in the state and the consequ are truli extrem danger unless macedonia urgent undertak someth in the area of legal regul and the intern organ of all structur and supervis bodi i think that in two or three year we will find ourselv in the same situat as some of the neighbor countri
