the duma not onli are the interfact allianc movabl but each faction itself is not monolith and is also movabl sinc the leader ambit and the increas influenc of person within their associ will also play their role whi the democrat lost and what conclus should be drawn from their defeat is a question that ha been discuss quit thoroughli alreadi i onli wish to stress that if the govern carri out unpopular reform and at the same time want to win elect it should prepar itself support among the popul in advanc the decis on increas pension and the transfer of the militia to municip author after all our militia today cannot defend the citizen i have encount thi in my own life should have been publish not today after the elect but befor them voter refus to follow the word democrat out of

longer time to take shape the plant s profit should be tax onli after all expens necessari for purif instal have been deduct from them i am sure that i manag to win the elect campaign not by hand out imposs promis but onli becaus my program notic that it is a liber program and therefor doe not enjoy absolut support today wa absolut specif the liber democrat parti pf russia ha such a broad represent in parliament becaus it combin the vote of those who therebi express their dissatisfact with the inconsist of the reform and of those who truli share the idea of the leader of that parti howev zhirinovskiy s parti today repres a big question mark in my view everyon is talk about it leader but what do hi comrad in arm repres will it receiv a polit weight in parliament correspond to it size thi will be shown by the proceed in parliament even today howev it is clear that given such a parliament it is imposs to expect the clear cut advanc of reform there will also be difficulti over the format of the govern the power ministri and foreign polici much will now depend on the presid who thank god ha been given signific power under the new constitut a huge part will also be play by the extent to which both communist and democrat take respons stanc to what extent they are profession and analyt in their choic let us have no more fight to prove who is clever and stronger let us have as much negoti and as much accord as possibl h5 vladimir lysenko period of grace for parliamentarian h5 the yavlinskiy boldyrev lukin bloc is prepar quit serious for parliamentari work yavlinskiy in the epitsentr econom and polit research center ha drawn up mani document and we have interest social and econom program we will have plenti of thing to propos to the state duma our faction is one of the few which propos to creat a parliament base not upon a rigid faction system but on a soft option that is to say that as a rule deputi should work in the faction for whom they were elect but it would be incorrect to bind deputi so rigidli that they could be expel from parliament if they have some kind of differ with their faction or want to switch to anoth faction thi is incorrect becaus the rule of the game were initi differ neither the statut on the feder assembl nor the constitut provid for rigid disciplin within faction second it should be born in mind that in a transit period much chang event move from one stage to anoth and posit chang too for instanc i have mani friend in russia s choic and in shakhray s bloc with whom i would like to cooper but i do not rule out that the situat could reach a point as often ha been the case with the democrat where we could end up virtual as each other s main enemi if we pursu the previou polici i am also think of the activ of certain bloc leader henc it seem to me a deputi should have the right to chang faction at least onc i am for the democrat coordin their action in parliament everyth should be discuss and agre between ourselv beforehand we should find common ground on which to stand in negoti with the rest unfortun there are other approach in our faction some deputi believ that we should reach agreement with the communist on one issu and with russia s choic on anoth thi posit keep equidist from either side is quit frankli alarm h5 yekaterina lakhova women will not be tame h5 we realiz that voter who support the women of russia bloc in the elect will follow close how we justifi their trust either we will discredit the women s movement or we will strengthen it we intend to work serious in parliament in order to overcom the tradit idea of women s low polit activ and to fight to increas women s social statu right now it is intoler low we serious intend to fight to see that a woman is elect one of the deputi chairmen of the state duma it is time to stop treat half the popul of the countri like second class peopl we should not be a laugh stock in the world commun i think that parliament should activ influenc the format of state polici insofar as thi polici is form in law everyth is in our hand i object to the idea that if the govern doe not chang it cours we should not support it we can influenc thi cours by adopt new law and make ration amend to exist legisl especi as regard properti question privat and so forth will our faction s voic be heed in parliament it is hard to predict at thi stage but we will not be tame that is unequivoc peopl are constantli tri to pin women of russia to someon els s coattail now to one bloc now to anoth i think that everi faction will tri to preserv it autonomi we will find common approach in resolv some problem but we will also seek alli in other faction to lobbi for our issu we will tri to make ourselv heard especi sinc there is the experi acquir in the previou parliament we will take account of thi just as we will take account of past mistak
