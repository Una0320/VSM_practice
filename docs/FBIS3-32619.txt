languag f p 105 spanish f articl type bfn f p 106 news confer by colombian presid cesar gaviria with f unidentifi moder and domest report at narino presidenti palac in santa fe de bogota broadcast in progress live text gaviria that allow militari member of other countri to undertak joint exercis with the colombian militari in the implement of old practic that are back by intern agreement unfortun in respons to a well found legal document that i sent to that judici bodi some day ago with the utmost respect a press communiqu wa releas that lack legal argument i learn of the communiqu through the media not through proper channel as if it were more import to gener a particular climat of public opinion than to strictli carri out a legal procedur thi attitud contrast with the one i assum with the state council to which i gave detail and confidenti explan awar of the implic that thi debat ha for our countri in the nation and intern arena i receiv the news with the peac of mind of know that these type of oper are necessari use and opportun for colombia as well as with the confid that the legal argument that the state council reject are solid and that the decis that were made do not violat the constitut which under the leadership of thi administr embodi the great chang that colombian societi had demand for year for it polit organ i continu to believ that we had to strengthen the institut that exert control and give congress the mean to exercis it oversight function of the action of the execut branch that is whi we will be readi to provid congress the bodi to which the state council decid to remit the issu with the explan that it consid relev with the assur that they will not be reject with the stroke of a pen but analyz strictli and calmli from what is infer from the brief statement of the judici institut it seem that the state council ha given a constitut provis a scope that it obvious doe not have they are tri to claim that the duti of request senat or state council permiss for foreign troop to temporarili enter our countri mean that it is necessari to request such permiss for ani foreign militari man to enter colombia regardless of the purpos of hi visit such an interpret ha led to the absurd of assert that to allow the entri of the militari attach which dozen of countri have in colombia just as we have in as mani countri would requir that permiss or that a joint intellig oper to pursu a crimin would requir the prior meet and pronounc of the senat it would also mean that valid intern agreement with long stand tradit such as the inter american treati of reciproc assist and the 1952 militari assist agreement have somehow magic lost their effect and that colombia should therefor fail to fulfil all their claus it is clear that thi is not the spirit of thi constitut nor of the constitut that have govern us sinc 1821 which have invari establish a similar polici what the polit constitut seek is to establish a procedur for grant permiss for the transit or station of foreign troop that have warlik object against a third countri it doe not in ani way seek to regul joint train oper the oper of advanc technolog equip the mainten of equip or technic assist all of which are part of valid intern treati if thi issu of such import had been studi veri care it would not have been difficult to conclud that thi norm wa establish for situat in which foreign armi are confront other nation a situat in which the nation s neutral would be compromis and which would obvious demand a pronounc from the senat which is also empow to declar war the state council should rememb that the drafter of the constitut of 1886 had in mind the isthmu of panama which we then held which explain the refer to the dock of foreign war vessel sinc 1926 the state council ha veri clearli identifi the case in which prior author by that bodi wa unnecessari these statement should still be complet valid the state council ha said that act befit brotherhood and intern courtesi and all those the constitut endow on the presid as the suprem administr author do not compel the govern to consult the state council can a judici bodi say that we are respons for certain thing becaus we abid by previou rule about 17 month ago day after the escap of escobar in respons to a concern publicli voic by the then state council presid i forward to that bodi a statement where i made the same argument i am reiter now at that time the state council the same state council that today is chang colombia s tradit legal interpret of thi matter did not refut the argument in my letter but seem instead to agre with and accept them we are face an unusu cirucumst where the presid is be held respons not for make a decis but for share and support the legal reason on which it wa base and that the state council had tradit accept the state council s statement is not a legal decis it simpli appris congress of it action and i must point out the govern ha provid all the document and the judici branch ha onli said it doe not find the state council statement convinc the consequ of thi decis is no other than the acknowledg by the selfsam state council that it lack the author to review the alleg violat of the constitut and order the appropri sanction all of which fall within the purview of the congress the state council s statement is not legal but polit the vagu of the statement of that bodi and even the fact that it presid is argu over the radio that colombian artisan can build a littl school do not constitu a legal argument worthi of respons until a compet organ make a decis we will continu to pursu intern cooper and ani joint exercis the govern may consid essenti to improv the train of our militari forc thi cooper which is most advis for the countri is base on intern treati ratifi by the congress these exercis mere constitut the implement of these treati and not a de facto situat cooper in intellig advisori servic and mainten is vital in the struggl against crimin drug traffick organ the radic interpret express in the state council s press statement may benefit drug traffick and will undoubtedli weaken our capabl to deal with crime colombian i understand there may be those who disagre with the joint exercis conduct along colombia s pacif coast i cannot ignor a shallow legal interpret that may make us renounc oper that are indispens to defend ourselv from crime and drug traffick as a matter of fact the govern ha admit there have been flaw in keep the public inform perhap thi ha prompt differ peopl from speak out against militari cooper with the unit state i am certain that onc peopl hear my explan today that mani will chang their opinion we have conduct differ joint action with the u s govern to improv and increas the effici of our polic oper we have receiv technolog in the form of radar equip that is direct and oper by colombian and for which u s personnel provid us with advic and mainten we have conduct joint engin exercis for the construct of variou project almost 100 colombian soldier are current in the unit state particip in oper similar to those that have come under fire in colombia and it ha never even cross anyon s mind that those soldier might pose a threat to the sovereignti of the unit state in all thi debat there are at least two contradict the first is the belief that these effort to improv the colombian public forc s train and effici constitut a violat of our sovereignti when in realiti these effort are aim at guarante our sovereignti sovereignti is much more at risk with a nation in the hand of crimin and drug traffick with a nation lack the capac to react to crimin activ with a state baffl in the face of thousand of clandestin flight by foreign and local aircraft that are traffick drug than with a state apparatu that appeal to intern cooper to guarante the rule of law and the legitim exercis of the right of it citizen it is also surpris that we demand the intern commun s support for the colombian peopl s brave struggl against the major drug traffick organ and now we are say that thi support is a threat to our sovereignti as someon said some time ago intern cooper is not a few pat on the back it is among other thing train and logist support sovereignti is not a rhetor concept that is defend with speech on the public squar dure elector campaign or by simpli rant anti american chauvinist statement base on opportunist nation or popul our independ in the sphere of intern relat is open to everyon s scrutini let everyon see how we have conduct ourselv at the variou intern forum how our repres have vote at the unit nation oa and other multilater organ how we have play an activ role in the nonalign movement and the group of 77 how we have resum relat with cuba in short let everyon see the daili perman dynam that ha place colombia in a posit of leadership in latin america citizen sovereignti is defend when one brave confront the fatherland s enemi when one confront those who threaten the peopl s secur and take advantag of and violat our territori river sea and airspac to conduct crimin activ sovereignti is not an abstract valu a simpl dead letter in the law or constitut we are more sovereign when we are abl to exercis greater control we are more sovereign when we strengthen the colombian arm forc capabl to do their duti of defend the countri s secur and integr we are more sovereign when we acquir alli that support us in our battl against stateless individu who murder our women and children word indistinct thi constitut the defens of our sovereignti those who wrap themselv in the colombian flag and tear their hair over the alleg violat of our sovereignti becaus we allow technician and militari engin from other countri into colombia are mistaken our enemi are power to defeat them it is not enough for us to employ technolog abil or sacrific we need solidar and support what would have happen to europ if it leader had not had the vision to form an allianc to combat the specter of hitler what would have happen to colombia if we had relinquish intern cooper in our battl against the then self style medellin cartel would we perhap be freer more sovereign or more independ live under the tyranni of escobar s narcoterror would we be freer more sovereign or more independ by let crimin from all countri and of all ilk violat our airspac would we be freer and more independ by let drug traffick have everi technolog advanc at their dispos while we take shelter in our modest technic capabl renounc intern aid until 7 august when my mandat end i will continu my effort to expand our democraci modern our countri diminish poverti and injustic and face without hesit those who sow destabil and fear until we prevail over them fear of debat will not make me hesit to make or support decis such as the one be discuss within the framework of the constitut which thi govern know well whenev i feel it is for the good of the republ or to fight crime purpos which the major of colombian share who prefer to open themselv to the futur and not cling to the past thank you first unidentifi report in progress the exercis of u s servicemen with colombian servicemen the opinion issu by the state council talk of troop what legal argument are you defend and whi gaviria i will tri to summar those legal argument that are contain in the letter i sent to the state council with which i believ all of you are familiar and which unfortun the state council answer with a brief statement fundament those argument are the follow colombia ha sever intern treati that are current in effect they includ agreement stem from the word indistinct intern treati as well as other intern agreement such as the 1958 geneva convent the chicago convent that regul air traffic and a number of agreement deriv from those treati the juanchaco oper personnel as well as the personnel in other oper be held in the nation territori the naval armi and polic mission in the countri the exchang of militari personnel and militari student and the support personnel for mainten and assist of our radar oper are not militari troop whi do i say thi in the messag i sent to the state council i clearli establish the legal anteced for the constitut norm the anteced alway refer to the time when militari troop pass through colombia and when panama wa part of colombia they mention belliger troop that are particip in a war against anoth countri or go to anoth countri thi ha noth to do with militari cooper activ all countri accept and want such cooper we have been develop thi militari cooper for the past 50 year we have had militari personnel from the unit state and other countri come to our countri for the past 50 year thi exchang began around 1952 thu for almost 50 year we have had foreign militari personnel and mission here we have sign agreement and memorandum and we have carri out militari exercis base on thi tradit which ha never been question over the past 40 year the defens ministri ha continu to make those decis in accord with thi interpret now the state council say it doe not agre with that interpret and ha submit thi matter to the congress of the republ which we agre is the compet bodi for render interpret unfortun as a result of the state council s ambigu and short statement or opinion it may be infer thi is not specif state that all militari personnel must leav colombia i imagin they are refer to militari personnel of colombia and other countri under thi absurd interpret one could even go so far as to expel all militari attach from colombia which would be follow with the expuls of our militari attach from other countri therefor thi is what ha place the govern in thi situat becaus word indistinct judici but the opinion of state council member there is no rule no caus no resolut the state council is not settl anyth it is onli express a doubt that the govern doe not share about a jurid interpret what ha the presid of the republ done in thi case i have defend the legal argument with which the countri ha work for nearli 40 year and which had never befor been call into question moder diana mateo repres radio newscast mateo good afternoon mr presid all colombian are wonder whi these u s soldier arriv in the countri amid so much secreci and whi they arriv arm the peopl wonder whi the countri didn t hire the unemploy to undertak these project thi endang nation sovereignti given that there are so mani unemploy in colombia gaviria look these peopl arriv to implement a cooper treati or agreement we had with the unit state that wa the decis the defens minist made that ha been done in the past in colombia on mani occas joint exercis are conduct everi year as the militari engin exercis continu they decid to give the commun where they were oper someth that help that commun that is obvious be done at the expens of the foreign govern the u s govern it doe not take away job oportun from colombian and it doe not affect the resourc of colombian in some of these oper these peopl thi is also a long tradit to which colombian soldier are also entitl are author to carri person weapon not weapon of war there is a long tradit in all countri and within intern law that permit thi i obvious respect those who think that thi is not conveni or who oppos these exercis which is not the same as the exercis be unconstitut or us not act in accord with the constitut treati and agreement thi can also be argu i am not say it cannot be discuss but we must bear in mind the govern ha act in keep with a long jurid tradit for which there are mani anteced moder francisco soli of el tiempo repres the print media is next astid legarda will follow soli good afternoon mr presid do you believ that all colombian who fear thi presenc of u s soldier in civil cooper activ as you said are perhap rememb the incid that led to panama s separ do you think all these peopl are mistaken gaviria no i understand there may be fear in latin america there are alway fear about thi type of presenc howev with a small limit presenc to conduct exercis when dozen of similar exercis have been carri out in the last 40 year i frankli do not think these fear are justifi i might acknowledg that there may be some oppos view or some peopl oppos to these exercis but to go from that to say that we have act unconstitut or outsid of strict complianc with treati or implement of said treati is a big differ anoth thing i would like to point out is that some of these oper are veri much need almost indispens while other are not the oper in juanchaco is not indispens we could have done without it in the long run it wa an oper an exercis of engin that we could have done without unfortun the opinion or judgment of the state council would involv not just that exercis but all kind of militari cooper radar assist intellig cooper all intern cooper that help us in the drug struggl would end accord to the state council s opinion we would have to violat intern treati and agreement to satisfi that opinion that is what the presid of the republ cannot do under these circumst without fail to compli with hi duti or the veri constitut which establish intern commit with which we must compli for instanc the geneva convent establish the safe passag of warship we are signatori to that convent we can neither violat nor ignor it becaus of a judgment issu by a colombian judici bodi we cannot do that we have a commit in airspac matter and a decre regul such commit we cannot abandon those commit overnight i go back to the point i made in my statement how is colombia s sovereignti defend by tri to prevent plane work for drug traffick group and without flight plan from endang our air secur and by seek intern cooper to prevent thi are there colombian who think that we must toler these risk to air secur and thi violat of our sovereignti instead of resort to certain intern cooper no i don t think so i don t think mani colombian feel

are mani other activ not necessarili link to drug traffick the problem with the council s statement is that it question not onli the juanchaco oper but everi other form of militari cooper here i have a statement by presid alfonso lopez michelsen which bring up preced even from the recent past hi statement show whi thi interpret cannot be stretch so far as to becom absurd histor the interpret in colombia ha appli to troop with warlik intent not troop that are part of a cooper agreement the troop now in colombia are not troop for war but troop particip in a militari cooper program troop like thi have been here for more than 40 year yet no one ever question their presenc and virtual no statement on thi matter have been made in all these year thi is what i meant in thi particular instanc

that when we were look for escobar we accept cooper from mani countri includ surveil aircraft that flew over colombian territori there wa even disagr with the presid of the state council on thi issu i do not regret have done thi i accept intern cooper becaus i thought and still think it wa legal to go after escobar and dismantl the medellin cartel and i also believ that our sovereignti is better

gaviria peopl get veri passion dure elector campaign in colombia and in all countri the campaign increasingli assum a populist ting you see peopl word indistinct who suddenli start endors a populist posit peopl tend to get too passion and sometim they lose their object somewhat but i would not like to base thi debat on polit whi among other reason the state council is not involv in polit and ha no part in polit i believ the state council s opinion is it own i frankli do not believ the state council took the time to care studi all our argument in detail and to examin all the consequ of it opinion i don t think the state council did thi i regret that it did not and i also regret to say thi but i firmli believ it is true of cours thi issu could be use by the peopl in the polit campaign i

veri angri with the state council don t you think it is inconveni for the countri to be face a possibl confront between the execut legisl and judici branch in the midst of a polit campaign also is it possibl that you are be driven by your desir to get to the oa gaviria word indistinct i wa not refer to thi i know the state council is not motiv by such intent no we present thi issu i am concern becaus the state council ha said that there is a lack of legal preced and there are irregular with the way in which the decis wa made if word indistinct it would have been easier to decid and see what would happen but we are confront with an opinion or a simpl declar i am not quarrelsom but i do defend what i believ i am not intimid by ani decis or argument i fight for the thing in which i firmli believ i am not angri i don t usual get mad but i do have firm convict and what you are hear from me right here is just that my firm convict i believ the legal argument we forward to the state council are valid i continu to believ they are valid the state council s communiqu did not deni those argument i will continu to fight for our legal argument and for the nation interest mani thing are at risk here all intern cooper receiv by colombia design to strengthen it public forc and to help in it struggl against drug traffick all thi is in jeopardi i believ thi is seriou and danger for the countri

continu thi legal and polit struggl until the end i will do so peac and convinc that our posit will prevail
