signific cours of nuclear fuel recycl h5 ef let s begin with mr suzuki we sincer appreci your work on the nuclear fuel recycl expert subcommitte report issu on 10 juli 1991 sinc then the intern trend toward non prolifer ha becom more dynam with the problem over what to do with the plutonium from dismantl nuclear weapon in the former soviet union the transport of plutonium from franc to japan by the akatsuki maru and so forth what do you think suzuki two year have pass sinc we issu the nuclear fuel recycl report and dure that time mani factor for chang have arisen one key point in that report is the fact that it show in number the cost of plutonium suppli and demand over the next 20 year or so anoth point is that the report emphas we should reveal beforehand both at home and abroad japan s plan for plutonium util and in the spirit of open proceed with those plan these two issu will be import from now on as well i think we should care reconsid the quantit balanc of suppli and demand in the hear to revis the nuclear energi long term plan moreov as far as open is concern i think it will be increasingli import for japan to be as up front as possibl about her plan for peac util of nuclear energi when we consid the rapid shift toward nuclear disarma accompani the fall of the soviet union the problem with north korea and so forth i sincer hope the long term plan subcommitte will consid thi care and if they do then the key issu will be what will happen to japan s fbr commerci plan ef it appear that the plan for fbr commerci is attach by it umbil cord to the hear on the long term plan that mean that fbr commerci and plutonium util are realli two side of the same coin thi relationship becam crystal clear when the continu sinter furnac that make fuel pellet for the prototyp reactor monju broke down and delay critic for the third time some peopl on the basic subpanel which ha the job of overse the expert subcommitte work on the long term plan have said that we must decid whether to give prioriti to the balanc of plutonium suppli and demand or to cost effect suzuki both cost effect and balanc plutonium suppli and demand are import but in discuss up till now consist in govern polici ha been consid more import than cost effect becaus of the posit of the atom energi commiss of japan so it seem to me that the discuss over plutonium suppli and demand ha receiv more attent from an intern standpoint howev if we tri to go ahead with a specif plan in the futur then it is import to consid how much it will cost in that sens mani peopl are now discuss how we should handl the issu of cost effect at least that is my understand everyon associ with nuclear power in japan believ that plutonium will sure becom an import sourc of energi in the long run but if we accept the premis that plutonium is absolut necessari then we also have to say that it doe not matter how much it will cost howev in order to master the use of plutonium for the futur we must make the oper both streamlin and cost effect and an extrem import point will be how much we can increas thi cost effect streamlin from now on mox process will cost more than uranium process but if we say it is better just becaus it cost more that is not the true reason actual there are two advantag we can cut down on uranium usag if we recycl plutonium in lwr and uranium enrich will no longer be necessari furthermor if we make plutonium mix fuel of cours we have to pay the process cost but in ani event we should be abl to find a happi medium i think we should make thi a goal for technolog develop in other word i think it is veri import that we should attach great import to the govern s approach that we not possess excess plutonium and at the same time we should also pursu cost effect streamlin of the oper ef mr washimi what is the posit of those in the electr power industri washimi from a secur standpoint i think we should clearli adopt the concept of plutonium balanc as nation polici and move in the direct of not possess excess plutonium i think the basic path to achiev thi is to adopt mox fuel and use plutonium in fbr my reason is that we cannot acquir energi for the 21st centuri if we do not util plutonium but when we consid cost effect as well we cannot simpli say that pursu a balanc in suppli and demand should be our polici no matter how much it cost the electr power industri collect a fee from everyon who use electr and one basi for make decis is how much of that fee can be appli to the cost of prepar futur energi suppli on the other hand technolog develop take a veri long time to bear fruit when we look at the histori of lwr develop it ha taken about 30 year we have been told that even if we begin develop for fbr commerci today it will be 2030 befor the age of the fbr truli arriv all the peopl who are aliv until that time will be custom of the electr power industri and it is up to us to find out how much of their electr bill they will allow us to use to pay for technolog develop from that standpoint the electr power industri cannot boldli promot fbr commerci without the consent of the populac therefor i believ the electr power industri should not act on it own but should discuss the matter with scholar and the govern then in some form or other we should draw a line to indic how much capit we think we ought to invest in the futur and strive to work within that rang ef mr suzuki the idea that plutonium util and fbr will be expens that ha been embrac by democrat parti non prolifer hardlin in the u s congress and mr leventh the anti plutonium activist ha attain wide accept most american nuclear weapon have plutonium warhead and american belief are strongli root in a societi where peac and militari use of nuclear energi have been mix togeth suzuki when plutonium is not recycl it is commonli call one through in the case of one through we cannot determin the final stop point in other word can we or should we get rid of all our spent fuel no countri ha tri thi yet even in discuss in the u s comparison are made without clarifi thi issu and so in the true sens of the word comparison of cost effect are not possibl what is import in explan whi recycl is reason is whether spent fuel is consid a use resourc or not i believ it is a use resourc so for me the problem is when and how much of it will be recycl as a resourc rather than simpli a problem of cost effect i think thi is a nearli insolv problem if we do not consid how we will obtain a stabl long term suppli of the resourc in the past the rule ha been that spent fuel will be recycl as a resourc as soon as possibl but there is realli no need to hurri i think it is import to use the right amount of spent fuel at the right time as a resourc and definit not dispos of it as wast ef but japan doe not have a lot of land washimi japan is a small countri but nuclear fuel itself is veri compact and we are still debat whether we should dispos of spent fuel entir or keep it for process either way if we can obtain the consensu of the major of the populac it will not take up a lot of space on the other hand by the second half of the 21st centuri we will begin to reach the end of our buri reserv of oil and natur ga and their price will gradual rise even if the fbr were develop right away although it would be more expens than gener electr from oil burn plant right now as power produc we must give the highest prioriti to the issu of which path will place the smallest burden on our custom in the futur when price of lng and oil have gone up i believ that we can acquir adequ cost effect at that time by improv and develop our present fbr technolog h5 weather the mass media storm h5 ef as a former newspap report i wa disappoint in the report of the transport of plutonium by the akatsuki maru it took more than six year to complet the u s japan atom energi agreement that place the two countri on an equal foot at that time near the end of the negoti the u s wa insist on transport by air but japan resist howev the state of alaska and other protest becaus anchorag airport would lie along the cours so the murkowski amend wa pass by congress to revers the u s posit if the newspap report had bother to learn the histori behind plutonium transport they would not have report the event in that way washimi it is necessari to util plutonium in order to guarante a futur sourc of nuclear fuel for power gener in accord with thi basic plan we had the reprocess done oversea recov the plutonium and brought it back on the akatsuki maru i consid thi one step we have taken toward the futur at that time we were oppos by greenpeac but i think that perhap we did not strive hard enough to seek their understand about plutonium in addit we could not reveal absolut everi bit of inform to the public becaus of the need to protect nuclear materi it is human natur that the more thing we keep hidden the more peopl want to know about them my understand is that the govern is review issu such as how to form mutual agreement and how much inform can be releas to the public these are certainli issu that must be consid therefor we must hold firm to our basic plan for convert unburn uranium 238 which account for 99 3 percent of all the uranium into plutonium 239 and use it suzuki what mr washimi said just now illustr a good lesson from the standpoint of protect nuclear materi in other word from the standpoint of secur it is onli natur that some inform is difficult to disclos to the public the govern ha follow the approach that it ha respons to the u s and to europ so inform disclos to the public should be kept to an absolut minimum howev mani ordinari citizen doubt whether that is the real issu or not inform concern safeti is not for secur but for safeti and they think that as much inform as possibl concern safeti should be avail to the public on the other hand inform that is absolut necessari for secur cannot be disclos to the public in realiti it is difficult to know where to draw the line through what we have just experienc we have learn that mani peopl in japan think non disclosur should be kept to a bare minimum and mani peopl in place like franc seem to feel the same way we have learn anoth import lesson as well we japanes tend to take for grant that becaus we are clearli limit the use of plutonium to peac purpos and are not even consid militari use peopl in other countri will natur go along with our plan our experi ha made us realiz onc more that that is not the case one more point is that becaus we japanes tend to think about plutonium and atom energi pure in term of peac util we have becom somewhat insensit to the use of atom energi in other countri japanes newspap and other media have paid littl attent to the north korean problem the foreign ministri ha had sever contact through formal diplomat channel and that is what we expect but newspap and public opinion poll show almost no interest i am sure that american find thi hard to believ they cannot understand how the japanes can be so nonchal about a neighbor countri want to go nuclear i am hope that thi flap about the akatsuki maru will be an opportun for japanes peopl to gain some understand of the work of intern peac ef i watch a special program broadcast on nhk on 23 may entitl japan the plutonium superpow ii the dream and realiti of nuclear fuel recycl i felt it wa so bias that i sent a letter with sever question to their offic of inquiri they pass my letter on to the head of the report divis but the respons i got back did not answer my question suzuki report talk to me too but it appear that the report had just come to me for inform and i did not appear on the program at all when the report talk to me they made it clear what the program intend to say so i wa not too surpris but when a report organ tackl the plutonium problem i guess we can expect them to be rather critic in mani instanc they did not acknowledg the fact and i wish they were a littl more enlighten regardless of their approach howev i am happi that they spent two even of prime time to look at plutonium it may not have been directli effect in open peopl s eye but a report from an unrel magazin publish visit me after watch the program and ask me if what he saw on the program wa true after i explain thing to him he wrote an articl expound the true fact of the situat so there ha been that kind of secondari effect i like to look at it in a posit light ef i watch it togeth with my wife and after it wa over my wife said to me whi don t you stop work your finger to the bone the futur is so bleak and develop the fbr will be a total wast washimi i agre with mr suzuki that it wa good for them to report on the plutonium issu at least after the first part of the nhk special that is how we felt but the second part wa just too one side for exampl the program state that there are 5 million ton of uranium resourc so the fbr is total unnecessari right now the amount of offici confirm unmin uranium is 2 1 million ton and even if we includ all the most probabl addit estim resourc it onli come to 3 4 million ton the onli way to get 5 million ton is to add in everi specul about uranium deposit that have not been confirm and may or may not exist we still do not know whether they are there or not not onli that the figur they use togeth with the 5 million ton are base on the premis that the price of uranium will go up to 100 lb right now it is onli 10 lb so i do not think their calcul are realist they should show more clearli how they arriv at those number look at anoth exampl the program report that reprocess will produc a sixfold increas in nuclear wast actual that is true right now but we have reduc the amount of high level wast with vitrif and almost all the wast is low level wast i wish they would have dug a littl deeper and explain there is a good chanc that reprocess will gener much less wast than direct dispos in the futur thank to a reduct in the amount of fuel we will use final i wish they had taken a long term view and address the basic issu that we were discuss earlier that plutonium is an import energi resourc for the futur and look at our present situat in move toward it applic ef what about my wife s statement that develop the fbr will be a total wast washimi a veri long time is need for technolog develop just look at airplan 30 or 40 year pass between the wright brother and jet aircraft even when we begin full fledg commerci of the fbr and work veri hard at it the develop will take 30 to 40 year current we are work veri hard on research and develop but we should look beyond that and make decis base on the fbr s use as a sourc of energi h5 fbr commerci and domest mox product far away h5 ef the power industri is lean toward domest product of mox fuel and i believ that prepar for domest mox product are one of the issu in the upcom long term plan review suzuki construct ha begun on the reprocess plant at rokkasho villag under the premis that it is for the util of recov plutonium and uranium the most effect way for util it is in the form of mox natur we must think about the structur of a domest mox fuel busi the electr power compani are encourag by thi move up till now pnc ha conduct technolog develop mainli in the three field of uranium enrich reprocess and mox fuel as they relat to the fuel cycl the mainstream of uranium enrich and reprocess ha alreadi move to the privat sector so that leav us with mox fuel when we look at the path of uranium enrich and reprocess in their transit from technolog develop to privat sector commerci it appear there are way to make better use of the fruit of technolog develop the biggest problem is personnel i believ it is veri import how we util the peopl who dealt with develop of mox fuel process technolog at pnc and who current possess vital know how when we make the transit to commerci i hope that thi time when we decid the direct of the busi structur we consid thi issu much more care than we did in the past ef i have seen the plutonium fuel no 3 develop lab at pnc s tokai work as you look at it from the front there is an fbr line on the left and an atr line on the right four year have pass sinc the build for the atr line wa complet but it is still stand empti one reason is the delay at the oma site for the atr demonstr reactor of cours i think pnc should bring in peopl from fuel manufactur and togeth make mox fuel both for the oma reactor and for the plutonium thermal reactor for power compani use suzuki just as you say the key point will be how well we make use of thi opportun and tie in the pnc expert in thi field to commerci the atr line is veri import and it must proceed on schedul from now on i have a feel that the peopl involv with mox fuel are take a rather narrow approach mox fuel allow rather flexibl design to be made and if we would do so i think cost effect streamlin with mox fuel will make a big jump forward i hope thi view will be includ when decis are made the heater on the sinter furnac for make fuel for monju broke down recent delay critic the caus are rather complex but fuel for the monju ha a plutonium content of more than 20 percent with a maximum enrich of about 25 percent pnc ha been make fuel for fugen for a long time but that fuel ha a plutonium content of 1 2 percent about 3 percent maximum go from that level to number in the 20 percent rang mean a plutonium content 10 time higher becaus it is difficult to guarante the same kind of yield for a fuel with 10 time more plutonium i expect thi will becom an issu from now on we can use a special campaign to make fuel for the fbr but in the futur we must make it on a product line that flow continu in the same way we make fuel for the lwr today a veri import issu will be how we achiev that level and in that sens i would like to see the no 3 develop lab be activ util ef when a convers wa held thi spring among some of the most promin leader in thi field it wa leak that one issu for studi in the long term plan hear will be consid the present trend whether the electr power industri can actual build a second or third demonstr reactor even though the present long term plan state that two or three will be built judg from the present trend when we look at the most recent hear in the fbr develop project expert subcommitte some peopl may propos an intern project for build the second and third demonstr reactor like iter in which japan the u s ec and russia have begun engin design for an experiment fusion reactor washimi right now there is a hot debat go on about when the first demonstr reactor will be built the present long term plan call for construct on the first demonstr reactor to begin in the latter half of the 1990 but it must be suffici base on our experi with monju and we must still get some kind of yardstick on cost effect furthermor there are some technic problem that are still at the r amp d stage howev the attitud of the electr power industri is that we should forg steadili ahead with the develop of the first demonstr reactor as far as the second and third demonstr reactor are concern we should make our decis with the belief that thi technolog will make steadi progress we are tri veri hard to make our first demonstr reactor a larg reactor like the super phenix in franc but it may not turn out that way thi is my person opinion but the larger the reactor the more time it take to deal with ani kind of troubl so i have a feel that we may eventu have a small reactor i believ that in addit to our experi with the first demonstr reactor our concept for the second demonstr reactor will be base on research on the variou possibl for build it in the futur the third reactor lie even farther down the road and although i am not complet sure i expect that one import standard for make the decis will be how much it will cost i believ it is import to reach a consensu on how much of the current fee for electr should be use to pay for the cost of futur energi ef mr suzuki you made an excel comment at the last meet of the expert subcommitte you said that if we proceed by focus on the reactor the burden will be pass on to the fuel cycl and we will be forc to think about reactor in term of the fuel cycl suzuki i made that statement right after we got the news that pnc s continu sinter furnac that wa make fuel for monju had broken down and that monju critic would suffer a long delay as we seek higher and higher level of perform in reactor specif the burden fall on the fuel and thing get veri difficult from the standpoint of acquir fuel monju fuel ha low densiti and the rod are short and thin when ask pnc could not say it wa unabl to make that kind of fuel actual make the fuel a littl thicker and much denser would have been a lot easier lwr fuel can be made that way pnc ha to make fuel that is harder to make than lwr fuel i think it will be import in the futur to adopt design in which the reactor and the cycl are technolog in balanc now we are concern with the process of make the transit to commerci so a veri import issu will be how much we can improv our technolog in that sens short term cost effect and so forth are irrelev it is import that we think of thi as technolog link to the futur and in that sens i want to see plan for demonstr reactor that take the fuel cycl into account h5 expect for new long term plan h5 ef in close do you have ani request for the long term plan expert subcommitte washimi as a basic line of reason i hope that the long term plan will not place too much emphasi on immedi result energi technolog take a veri long time to develop so it is not wise to make decis base onli on the present it is import to take a long rang view i also hope the committe look at thing from the standpoint of the gener populac i am sure that the basic framework of the long term plan will be clearli written down but i am wonder whether it could be put in the form of a stori that averag citizen can understand peopl concern with atom energi can understand if you say in the year two thousand and someth or other we will do thi but i do not think the averag citizen understand whi i think we need to publish a kind of cliff s note to the long term plan suzuki i work at a univers and deal with young student i want to think that in the futur they will be activ in the field of atom energi in that sens the long term plan is veri import and i think most peopl are particularli interest in what will happen to the fbr project in the nuclear fuel recycl expert subcommitte report we issu two year ago we said that we would need roughli 10 20 ton of plutonium for the fbr i think thi time we should express quantiti more precis if we do so i think that peopl involv in reprocess will be encourag and the target for mox manufactur will also becom clear of cours cost effect is veri import and power compani reflect thi in electr rate power compani cannot proceed on their own if the cost is too high therefor the most import problem for the upcom long term plan session will be express the fbr project in a way that most peopl can go along with not onli in the field of atom energi but in other field as well japan is show her econom and technolog strength to the rest of the world we must ask whether japan alon should bear the risk of technolog develop that will benefit the whole world as econom burden continu to increas intern cooper often mean mere provid fund atom energi is differ becaus by pour both econom and technic strength into technolog develop of the fbr we will benefit other nation as well in the futur i believ we have arriv at an age in which that will be our goal if that is the case there is a possibl the fbr project may be consid quit ration even if the financi cost is consider washimi i agre complet we must approach thi from the standpoint that the plutonium recycl fbr is not onli energi for japan but energi for the whole world we must also look at it as someth for futur gener as well as for those aliv today therefor cost effect come into play becaus the money will come from fee paid by today s user of electr in japan basic we must consid the futur of the world s energi and ask ourselv how much of the burden our gener should bear
