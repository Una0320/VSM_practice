under market economi condit text in a decad plu of econom reform china ha been through a transit from plan economi through plan commod economi to socialist market economi in the cours of establish and develop market economi oper forc the tax system will need constant improv to turn it into a polici mean for help to bring the impact of market forc into full play and to act with market forc in achiev the optimum disposit of resourc h3 i the principl for improv our tax system under a socialist market economi h3 1 the revenu principl organ revenu is the basic function of taxat econom oper base on a market economi requir taxat premis on not obstruct econom oper in the privat sector to rais the maximum revenu which is the financi guarante for a socialist countri to realiz it social and econom function but china s realiti is that a decad plu of econom reform ha been accompani by a similar period of fiscal deficit which total 259 876 billion yuan for the 12 year from 1979 through 1990 or 2 91 percent of nation incom for the period even exclud treasuri bond incom the shortfal from revenu rais mainli through taxat wa still about 88 billion yuan to averag 7 33 billion yuan a year such a sever revenu shortag had to be a key factor hamper econom reform 2 the fair principl as to tax burden the fair principl mean that when taxpay payment capabl is the same the same amount of tax are collect and when payment capabl differ tax are collect base on taxpay capabl legal the tax fair principl mean that tax collector and taxpay have an equal stand as to tax law with variou taxpay also all be equal in the face of the tax law as to enterpris taxpay it is onli when tax are collect fairli that enterpris will have rel ration tax burden to allow for free competit and as to individu taxpay collect tax base on payment capabl help to redistribut social wealth shrink the polar between the rich and poor and creat the greatest public welfar 3 the regul principl as the govern s mean of econom regul taxat ha both a microeconom and a macroeconom regul function in the process of distribut and redistribut nation incom taxat employ step such as collect or not collect tax on certain econom activ collect more or less tax and limit tax bonus to affect and regul balanc the suppli and demand of certain product to realiz the optimum disposit of resourc and industri structur goal while thi is the microeconom regul function of taxat taxat is also a mean of regul macroeconom oper the basic state of china s current market economi is an out of equilibrium economi the conspicu manifest of which is the imbal between overal suppli and demand the govern can rais or lower tax to curb or increas overal demand to bring it into line with overal suppli we can go on to say that the regul principl mean that taxat need the function of promot product oper effici in microeconom activ as well as that of stabil macroeconom oper h5 ii tax reform mistak h5 china s econom reform have a gap in revenu taxat reform while a decad plu of tax reform ha ad mani tax categori to improv our tax structur the guid ideolog of streamlin administr and devolv author and tax reduct and profit concess ha led all along to the take of variou tax reduct step for the key tax revenu sourc enterpris incom tax even to the point of tax reduct remain the major tax reform offens direct today when the new econom oper forc of a market economi are be establish data show that from 1981 to 1990 state support for enterpris through the tax reduct and profit concess polici amount to net financi resourc worth 310 billion yuan includ 244 8 billion yuan dure the seventh five year plan or 19 13 percent of revenu for the period while the ground for tax reduct are that it invigor enterpris i hold that under today s condit when our socialist market economi is just develop and we have no sound econom and legal institut suit to the oper law of a market economi continu with the same old tax reform guid ideolog of tax reduct would be bound to lead china s tax reform astray enterpris have not trueli been invigor becaus they are retain more profit while inadequ revenu leav the govern powerless to control the overal econom situat first take a look from the enterpris perspect 1 when market forc are not veri strong and enterpris action are irrat tax reduct cannot genuin help enterpris becom more effici through competit as our socialist market economi is just take off with china s societi and economi still lack a complet and mutual restrain market system be particularli short of market forc center on a ration price structur enterpris are actual in an unfair market opportun state in addit enterpris have not yet complet establish intern mechan for self restraint and self develop or been subject to full competit pressur in thi state tax reduct to increas the real budget incom of enterpris allow them to acquir more liber extern term not through their own effort they need onli to strive for advantag polici an exampl be 1993 s wave of phoney joint ventur to achiev their own profit object without have to spend more energi on rais effici the pertin data on the ratio of materi consumpt to gross output valu in china s industri sector show it to have been 68 1 percent in 1986 but up to 72 4 percent by 1990 so the tax reduct polici had to have been a contribut factor to enterpris inertia 2 when the state economi s properti right have not been genuin put in order so that enterpris lack long rang invest motiv tax reduct doe not fulli play the role of stimul invest in our decad plu of econom reform the state economi s properti right relat have remain unclear all along keep commod produc behavior out of line with market rule meanwhil as enterpris have no inher drive for long rang develop plu steadili increas budget incom their real asset have not clearli accumul and grown with incom be slant more toward consumpt the data for 1985 to 1990 show that china s gvio grew at an averag rate of 13 1 percent a year while employe payrol in the industri sector rose an averag of 17 8 percent a year in thi state of affair the incom realiz through tax reduct move limit resourc from the invest arena to the consumpt stage turn product capit into consum fund stimul an excess increas in public consumpt fund and sharpen the overal imbal between suppli and demand then take a look from the govern s side 1 when the govern s statu and function in econom activ have not yet been clearli delimit and spend demand is rigid and strong tax reduct can onli add to the fiscal burden by increas fiscal deficit and threaten the stabl growth of the nation economi while the tax reduct campaign in the u s in the 1980 had theoret ground hold that the govern must cut spend while reduc tax our realiti is that our govern s econom function have certainli not been clearli cut back with it still be respons for prioriti construct invest necessari to econom growth but long neglect and no lighten of the fiscal subsidi burden in sight so increas govern spend put enorm pressur on revenu sourc when spend is increas steadili and tax revenu are in a rel declin fund to financ reform can come onli through overdraw which then leav the door open for inflat 2 when econom growth and live standard are rise steadili the demand for public facil grow mean that the govern ha to come up with the fund for infrastructur improv and the tax reduct reform think certainli ignor the revenu demand in thi area 3 a socialist market economi requir the free flow of product essenti with the workforc mobil essenti in particular requir the govern to provid social guarante in area such as unemploy and pension which is a new fund demand 4 in our current govern bond system govern bond are unattract financi asset leav the govern with veri limit revenu from the fundrais mean of govern bond under such condit most govern fund need for either econom or social function must be rais through tax it is thu obviou that in the initi stage of the establish of a socialist market economi when mani econom relat cannot be complet ration and market forc cannot be made sound all at onc lower tax cannot solv problem such as the strong demand on govern revenu and the irration of enterpris action so i hold that in come tax reform we can no longer reform our tax system with the tax reduct think but that our tax reform should be base on stabil tax burden and revenu by improv our tax structur to build a tax system that is fair and can provid ampl revenu and regul the economi h5 iii tax reform idea under a market economi system h5 1 enterpris incom tax reform in light of market economi demand and in consider of china s object condit for some time to come i hold that acceler enterpris incom tax reform should be our tax reform prioriti for the next few year h5 a enterpris incom tax law need to be consolid h5 in the interest of fair tax burden we first need to break up the incom tax system that is set up on the basi of econom natur with all type of domest invest enterpris such as state collect privat jointli oper and sharehold enterpris be made subject to a uniform enterpris incom tax law and when the time is right merg of the incom tax law for domest and foreign invest enterpris and implement of a complet consolid enterpris incom tax law for industri and commerci enterpris as thi is a prerequisit for fair taxat as well as the consensu at all level throughout china there is no need to go into unnecessari detail h3 b incom tax need to be differ for larg and small enterpris h3 as our socialist market economi develop the goal model for the convers of enterpris oper forc is the sharehold system onc we go to a full sharehold system enterpris incom tax for small midsiz and larg enterpris will need somewhat vari tax treatment from the experi of oversea practic due to variou reason such as 1 small enterpris have littl profitmak capabl and prestig that is not yet establish or not high 2 the sharehold system requir larg financ and transact cost on primari and secondari market and 3 the sharehold system requir high cost for enterpris manag supervis and control and inform linkup between manag and sharehold onli 2 percent of small enterpris with less than 500 employe sell share at the time of their initi financ decis with still less than 20 percent do so by the time of their second financ decis in other word about 90 percent of small enterpris take loan from financi institut as their primari financ polici so in support of vital small enterpris growth we should adopt preferenti tax polici for small enterpris such as make the legal tax rate applic to small enterpris lower than that for larg and medium size one and offer broader invest tax prefer h5 c interest need to be includ in tax base h5 interest have long been tax free ha creat the bad phenomenon of the enterpris sector overr on bank loan for invest while use most of it own fund for welfar facil if interest expenditur were includ in tax base the enterpris incom tax system would actual be neutral toward all capit sourc while play the follow role 1 it would spur enterpris to rais the use effici of their borrow capit 2 on the capit demand side it would help to control credit scope 3 it would also have a certain restrict impact on invest scale h5 d tax rate need to be flexibl h5 the current focu of discuss in enterpris incom tax reform is tax rate design mani favor a 33 percent singl ratio tax rate i hold that such a tax rate is a particular reflect of the tax reduct guid ideolog be too low advers to the organ of revenu and detriment to govern use of tax leverag to regul nation econom oper i favor the enterpris incom tax collect method of first adopt the soft degre progress tax rate system and then make a transit to the proport flat tax rate system as our market economi is just be establish 1 govern revenu demand are strong while enterpris incom tax are the major sourc of revenu so that employ the progress tax rate system can bring rich revenu flexibl 2 in contrast to the individu incom tax it is onli the enterpris incom tax that play a key role in regul macroeconom oper so as the revenu so rais make up a veri larg percentag of overal tax revenu if we continu to use the progress tax rate make it flexibl it regulatori impact would grow 3 use the progress tax rate system would not affect enterpris invest initi in the current state of bank credit mechan restraint be soft enterpris properti right limit be unclear and enterpris action be sever short term even more enterpris retain profit would be hard to use for long term invest as wa explain abov in light of these factor we should set enterpris incom tax for the short term at a three level progress tax rate for excess incom of 35 40 percent then base on china s market economi develop and progress in convert enterpris oper forc enterpris incom tax could make a gradual transit to the flat tax rate system in fact befor the 1980 corpor incom tax in develop countri such as the unit state and japan all employ a three to four grade progress tax rate system for excess incom in addit enterpris incom tax flexibl should also be express in the follow two area 1 in order to encourag competit and rais product effici i recommend that onc the enterpris profit rate pass 20 percent each one point rise should lower the tax rate 1 point the profit rate is calcul as profit plu all loan interest exclud util gross capit includ all loan my reason for delimit the profit rate at 20 percent is that accord to econom theori assumpt in order for each industri to keep it output at a growth rate of 8 10 percent it profit rate must be abov 20 percent thi step would be a great encourag to enterpris with profit rate abov 20 percent as well as play a promot role for all enterpris in achiev thi profit rate and improv their econom effici 2 in order to stimul export and import substitut i recommend that each one point rise in the enterpris net export rate should lower the tax rate 1 point the net export rate is present export valu minu the present valu of raw materi and part import exclud the present replac valu of import machineri and equip thi could stimul the growth of import industri and export subsitut industri while rais the use effici of import machineri and equip 2 individu incom tax reform the individu incom tax system function to bring fair to individu incom level and regul overal demand be a key compon part of a flexibl tax system individu incom tax system reform includ three part 1 the individu incom tax system need consolid in other word the current individu incom tax individu incom adjust tax and individu industri and commerci household oper incom tax need to be merg into a consolid individu incom tax meanwhil both chines and foreign should be made subject to a uniform individu incom tax law with nonresid taxpay be provid with certain special deduct to solv the problem of high tax burden creat by incom differ 2 we need to abolish our individu incom adjust tax s excess multipl progress tax rate system and replac it with the progress tax rate system for excess incom which would be in line with intern practic as well as increas our taxat flexibl 3 individu busi incom should be made a part of the individu incom tax tax base in order to prevent tax revenu loss 3 flow tax system reform china s flow tax have alway use the tax inclus price model with tax rate design on the principl of high tax for high profit and vice versa it is obviou that under the plan price system flow tax regul profit not the consumpt that they should have but in market economi condit market form price domin so that tax rate should no longer be design on a plan price basi in addit as to tax categori everyth from product to circul and wholesal to retail should be subject to the valu ad tax with product tax collect on some product for a two tax overlap that is the neutral valu ad tax would be use for gener regul with product tax for special regul 4 expand tax base addit tax categori in order to adapt to market economi need china should as quickli as possibl begin to collect social insur inherit and gift capit gain and secur transact tax 1 the collect of social insur tax will help to lighten enterpris burden and promot ration labor mobil the pertin data show that in mani of china s older enterpris retire and pension make up one third of all employe with thi ratio even as high as 1 1 in a few enterpris pay wage to retir employe ha alway been a heavi burden on enterpris as well as obstruct ration labor mobil collect social insur tax will shift pension and unemploy insur payment from enterpris to the govern to equal the burden of old and new enterpris while open the way for labor mobil 2 collect inherit and gift tax will help to equal public wealth and tax revenu as china s live standard rise steadili person asset accumul and grow constantli and deal with the outsid world continu to expand the transfer and inherit of person asset occur often accord to intern practic china should also collect tax on the inherit or transfer of person asset abov a set amount 3 the collect of capit gain tax for separ taxat of corpor enterpris capit gain and oper incom is aim at practic a light tax polici for the sale of capit asset to encourag capit flow invigor capit market and encourag ventur invest 5 stronger tax control legisl as a market economi is one that is rule by law thi mean that tax collect control must have tax law as a yardstick 1 tax law need consolid tax author must be concentr and the legal liabil for the illeg action of decid without author to impos tax stop collect or make exempt ha to be investig and affix 2 illeg action such as tax evas or resist need to be crack down on sever 3 we need to strengthen our tax collect oversight by investig and affix the legal liabil of tax collector who abus their author for privat purpos and are derelict in their duti 4 and we need to use all mean to dissemin tax law knowledg by rais taxpay awar among all in order to push legal tax control to new height 6 a tax separ system as quickli as possibl in our tradit tax manag system the department selfish and polici of store wealth among the peopl of local govern brought a sharp eros of central govern tax revenu 1 china s central govern control veri few tax categori with most tax be collect on local govern respons which shift much tax revenu to extrabudgetari control make our tax system sever regress 2 while the author to draw up tax law and tax rate is nomin the center s it is actual all under local control as thi give local govern the opportun to loudli exploit tax reduct and exempt our tax reform remedi will be to thoroughli practic a tax separ system
