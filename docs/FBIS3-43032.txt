formal and visual inform on metabol pathway are describ a descript is given of the develop softwar which allow one to search for metabol pathway by key word their name name of substanc enzym and produc a graphic imag on the screen in variou form exist method of present inform on cell metabol in our opinion do not guarante effect access to the inform and do not allow one to appli modern analyt method the present of inform on metabol pathway in the form of graphic diagram is gener accept diagram of metabol pathway are encount in the major of biochemistri textbook and chart 1 2 and map 3 4 of metabol pathway are widespread author of origin scientif public on new metabol pathway also make use of diagram appar visual of inform in the form of diagram doe not have an altern becaus without graphic imag it is extrem difficult to repres a system in it entireti nevertheless present inform on cell metabol in the form of metabol map doe not guarante effect access to the inform and doe not allow one to appli modern comput analysi method the goal of thi work wa to creat a comput data base on metabol pathway that togeth with the use of tradit visual method would allow one to appli variou comput analysi method in thi case it would be necessari to develop an effect system that would allow one to store and quickli process inform on metabol pathway as well as make it possibl for one to interfac with other biochemistri and molecular biolog data base h3 primari stage of the technolog for support and util of the data base on metabol pathway h3 the gdmp graphic data base on metabol pathway is a softwar system for process and store inform on metabol pathway the primari portion of which are the languag for repres primari data the data base support softwar for the data base and softwar for access and analyz inform store in the data base technolog for oper the data base can be divid into three primari part translat of the origin inform on a metabol pathway into the formal languag for repres primari data the mpdl metabol pathway data languag input of chang into the data base via the mpbm metabol pathway base manag system and user access to inform via mpbr metabol pathway base retriev softwar the overal scheme of data base oper is shown in greater detail in fig 1 h3 formal the object field and the mpdl languag for repres primari data h3 metabol pathway determin there is no exact determin of metabol pathway nevertheless the current practic of divid overal cell metabol into individu metabol pathway indic that in such a divis nodal substanc play a key role in cell metabol nodal substanc particip in mani metabol transform as start substrat or final product an exampl of a nodal substanc is glucos 6 phosphat which particip in glycolysi glycogen synthesi the pentos phosphat pathway and mani other transform anoth exampl of a nodal substanc is pyruv with which mani metabol transform begin or end glucos 6 phosphat and pyruv are relat nodal substanc coupl by the glycolysi metabol pathway in thi work the metabol pathway is determin as a sequenc of reaction interact with each other through common intermedi that coupl relat nodal substanc in a confluent case the metabol pathway can be repres as a singl reaction in order to facilit graphic imag of metabol pathway and their analysi it is advis to util represent on the three hierarch organ level introduc in 5 for poli enzym system accord to 5 the interact of metabol pathway reaction through common intermedi compris the primari structur of thi pathway the primari structur doe not includ interact through common coenzym or regulatori substanc a well known exampl of use the primari structur for graphic represent of metabol is d nicholson s map metabol pathway 3 in the primari structur each substanc is repres by onli one node such a structur is the skeleton of the metabol pathway whose graphic imag is requir the addit of interact of reaction through common coenzym to the primari structur lead to a secondari or stoichiometr metabol pathway structur the complet imag of all possibl interact of a metabol pathway s secondari structur may be unsuit due to the multipl particip of coenzym in variou pathway reaction therefor the secondari structur is usual repres in a form in which connect through common coenzym are by broken line in such an imag each coenzym may be repres by sever node if it particip in sever reaction in order to simplifi imag sever connect through substanc in the primari structur may be by broken line usual these are simpl inorgan substanc of the type h sup 2 o co sub 2 orthophosph pyrophosph etc a well known exampl of use such a broken line secondari structur of metabol pathway is g michal s map biochem pathway 4 publish by boehring germani the set of all stoichiometr interact of the secondari structur supplement by nonstoichiometr regul interact compris the tertiari structur of the metabol pathway 5 in thi work onli the simplest task comput display of the secondari structur of metabol pathway is discuss in order to simplifi further present we will agre to call substanc that particip in primari structur interact and that are repres by uniqu node metabol pathway intermedi we will call substanc that supplement the primari structur up to the secondari structur as well as primari structur substanc that are graphic repres by broken non uniqu node cointermedi mpdl languag for repres data the mpdl languag for repres data is a subset of the format for repres data from the dbemp factual data base on enzym and metabol pathway 6 the mpdl languag is intend for formal describ metabol pathway and it includ softwar for describ the bibliograph sourc of inform the biolog sourc the intracellular local of enzym and the metabol pathway reaction themselv the mpdl file is in ascii format and consist of record a record is a logic unit of languag that describ an individu metabol pathway and consist of a sequenc of field a field consist of a titl locat in the first column and contain a portion separ from the titl by a space field are divid into requir and not requir the mpdl languag is compat with the dbemp format in such a way that ani mpdl record satisfi dbemp requir a dbemp record satisfi mpdl requir if it meet the follow two condit 1 the two field requir for an mpdl record are present 2 the mpdl syntax rule are follow represent of primari data on a metabol pathway in mpdl languag the describ version of the data base includ an mpdl variant in which a record may contain 10 field their design are briefli describ below an access number

intermedi contain name of metabol pathway intermedi but not cointermedi a sampl record in mpdl languag is given below h5 mpbm data base support softwar h5 mpbm softwar is execut in the form of a 300 k exe file it is in c languag quickc compil microsoft the system is intend for mpdl file contain mpdl languag record process by the expert oper with the goal of fill the data base enter chang to the graphic imag store in the data base and retriev when inform from the data base is need expert oper interfac with mpbm is accomplish by mean of a system of menu and dialog window mpdl languag translat the two way translat assur syntax and name verif and the format of intern represent of metabol pathway includ the stoichiometr matrix and the incid matrix for subsequ construct of graphic imag in gener the process proce with the particip of the expert oper who respond to system request in specif situat for exampl with the appear of an unknown substanc name in the system direct support of the expert is requir in order to remov mistak from the name metabol pathway imag gener descript the imag is a two dimension graph the graphic softwar is divid into three type of node and two type of branch each node type design a metabol pathway enzym intermedi or co intermedi see the section metabol pathway determin each enzym or intermedi is design by a singl node cointermedi are design by sever node each of which correspond to the co intermedi s particip in a given reaction a branch of the first type is alway direct from an intermedi to an enzym and indic the intermedi s particip as a substrat in an enzym catalyz reaction a branch of the second type is alway direct from an enzym to an intermedi and indic the intermedi s particip as a product in an enzym catalyz reaction an imag may also contain variou name for each node and be view on two differ scale initi planar configur of the graph a special inter algorithm for planar graph configur is util to construct the init imag 7 the algorithm is empir and intend for produc graphic imag that are visual well perceiv our experi indic that as a result of use the algorithm at least the gener structur of the graph is view well in conjunct with a sensit algorithm develop by us for the initi configur of point the system ask the oper to assign one of two method for initi configur of graph node util hi own knowledg regard the cyclic natur of the metabol pathway mpge graphic editor the mpge graphic editor is intend for put the metabol pathway imag in a form suitabl for visual analysi the editor s resourc take into account requir that are tradit impos on metabol pathway diagram but they do not restrict the author in the select of a method for planar graph configur all oper can be carri out with a mous the editor allow one to intermix individu node or group of node and to arrang a group of node in a circl of desir radiu or in a line of desir length oper may be conduct on two imag scale it is possibl to work with name node or without them with the input of chang the imag is automat reconstruct inform storag in the data base data base structur after an imag of the requir form is creat inform on the metabol pathway can be store in the data base by mean of a special command the imag form is store as node coordin the data base consist of 16 file in the relat subd paradox borland format that contain inform on metabol pathway in an intern form as well as support inform input of chang to the data base it is possibl to input two type of chang chang to the imag form and chang to metabol pathway inform at the mpdl commun level in the first case chang are enter by mean of the mpge editor in the second it is possibl to retriev inform on a metabol pathway from the data base by mean of a special command and then to input the appropri chang into the mpdl file and rewrit the necessari record see also fig 1 h5 softwar for access the mpbr data base h5 mpbr softwar is execut in the form of a 200 k exe file it is in c languag quickc compil microsoft the system is intend for assur user access to inform on metabol pathway and also includ softwar for analyz metabol pathway mpbr oper in the ega graphic regim user interfac includ a hierarch menu system a seri of pictogram and a help window system complet interchang of the keyboard and mous is assur the metabol pathway imag is also use as a graphic interfac version 1 3 octob 1992 contain the resourc describ below inform on data base content the user can obtain inform regard the number of metabol pathway contain in the data base as well as about the overal number of substanc and enzym that particip in them view metabol pathway diagram the user select a desir pathway from an alphabet list of recommend name of metabol pathway at which point he gain access to systemat and commonli use name of the metabol pathway as well as the biolog sourc given in the origin report a portion of the menu system with which these oper are execut is shown in fig 2 after select of a metabol pathway the system proce to the view regim the imag may be view in two rang transit to the larger scale proce with the aid of a movabl scale frame it is possibl to includ the name of graph node in the imag name are ec code or recommend name for enzym in agreement with the enzym classif in 8 and complet or abbrevi name for substanc in fig 3 made from a screen display a black and white imag of the citric acid cycl is shown figur 4 show how a portion of thi imag appear on a larger scale search for metabol pathway contain a specif substanc or enzym the user select a desir object from an alphabet list of substanc or enzym name and obtain a list of metabol pathway in which the given substanc or enzym particip a portion of the correspond menu system is shown in fig 5 thi list is analog to the gener list of recommend name see view metabol pathway diagram while view imag of metabol pathway from the list one can obtain inform about the particip of the enzym or substanc in each of them to accomplish thi the system automat select dure imag format via the graphic softwar the substanc or enzym about which the inquiri wa made h5 discuss of result and prospect develop h5 in thi work softwar for visual and process inform base on the gdmp data base is describ primari inform on the structur of a metabol pathway and the intermedi and enzym particip in it is contain in the data base howev sever import characterist have not yet been reflect by the data base softwar in the describ version of the data base inform on the intracellular local of enzym of a metabol path and their regul is absent it is plan to includ thi inform in futur version in the next version a link should also be establish with the factual data base on enzym and metabol pathway in dbemp 6 so that the user would be abl to obtain inform on the catalyt regulatori and molecular biolog properti of enzym particip in metabol pathway there is definit interest in our opinion for the user to have the resourc to view structur formula of intermedi via the estblish of a link with the correspond data base develop of softwar on the basi of thi data base for autom mathemat model and use algorithm for analyz graph for studi variou aspect of metabol pathway function appear interest and promis to us we will be grate for ani comment or suggest concern possibl for develop the system in
