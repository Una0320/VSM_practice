supermonopol state industri system the high degre of monopol in all sphere of life determin the system s destruct in relat to natur and man polic and polit control over ani kind of manifest of public activ made it more difficult for the reaction to thi destruct to develop at the same time howev societi s lack of influenti social subject independ of the parti and state made it paternalist function develop the state attempt to protect it subject from it own part as soon as the ecolog problem began to be recogn by the offici commun and that happen dure the thaw of 1953 1964 the parti and the state took some step to increas control over certain violat of ecolog standard abov all by privat citizen social activ which wa direct against these violat but did not affect polit aspect wa also legal thu began the first industri period of the ecolog movement approxim 1958 1982 dure thi period the movement wa typic built into the structur of offici public organ like the all union natur

accumul experi with the institution natur protect movement allow peopl to gradual come to the conclus that larg scale ecolog problem could not be solv within the framework of the offici structur the rapid buildup of ecolog problem in the second half of the 1970 and earli 1980 also promot thi awar the attempt to deal with thi wave of violat which were the result of object econom and social caus and the sin of the system led to an increas number of confront between the natur protect movement and the system s influenti link begin with bureaucrat poacher and end with the ministri which join the initi to revers the flow of the northern river ecologist were made to understand that they were interf in what wa not their busi the crisi of the movement brought a new stage of the movement into be the petit stage approxim 1982 1989 thi stage wa character by the greater independ and larger scale of the ecolog movement it still remain a natur protect movement and appeal primarili to the author intend to chang their particular decis and at the same time not chang the system but the ecolog movement and group independ select the object of the attack without take into account the elit s posit and resort to mass mobil mean they call on the popul and propos that they support the appeal to the author dure thi period the movement acquir a primarili negativist orient ecologist spoke out against the most destruct instal and project hope to restrain industri expans and local it harm consequ such a strategi in the ecolog organ unit peopl of the most divers view from conserv ethnocrat to anarchist the first mass campaign of thi stage end in success in 1986 the river revers project which had origin been support by the countri s highest leadership includ the architect of perestroyka wa cancel although the former system of water manag wa preserv and the problem of water suppli which revers the river wa suppos to resolv continu to worsen the posit of the countri s leader in relat to the grow ecolog movement in thi stage wa rel favor the protest of the citizen driven to desper wa direct against the local bureaucrat leadership and fit the strategi of pressur from below which wa suppos to make the local clan more conciliatori toward the perestroyka leadership the father of perestroyka appeal to the public they need a power public movement but one which would not encroach upon the foundat of the system that is on the highest leadership s author the origin apolit natur of the movement and the patriot conservat which later took on an anticommunist slant of mani of it leader from the writer milieu the concentr on particular object and the lack of a construct program seem to guarante that the process wa under control howev it becam explos the year 1987 1989 were the most product from the standpoint of the number of movement which aros and the scale of demonstr the need to coordin effort in the petit and ralli campaign brought broad associ of ecolog organ and movement to life in 1987 1988 the social ecolog allianc soe emerg in 1989 the even broader green movement emerg about a million peopl particip in the campaign against the construct of the volga chogray canal the success of the ecolog protest direct toward the elit were mark dozen of harm enterpris were shut down and project for revers water resourc and power engin giant the katun ge for exampl were buri but given the preserv of the former econom system thi promot greater paralysi of the economi which in itself wa caus by other thing these process promot greater opposit by the regim to the ecolog movement thi could not fail to caus the politic of the ecolog mass and that wa extrem danger to the cpsu which wa lose equilibrium the continu concess threaten the superindustri econom system with perman paralysi at the same time howev the ecolog crisi continu to expand despit the local success of the green sinc it wa caus by deeper reason than ill will or the stupid of particular functionari thi stalem meant a crisi not onli of govern polici in the field of ecolog but also a crisi of the ecolog movement itself the negativ of it demand dure thi period wa unpromis the problem built up faster than enterpris could be close but even the close of enterpris did not yet resolv the problem the ecolog movement need a construct altern and a posit ideal which could suggest a solut to the problem in principl the need for thi altern program wa also dictat by critic of the ecolog movement for it negativ natur from the veri start the ecolog movement had formul altern program capabl of offer solut to local ecolog crise but these altern were primarili technic their great complex as compar to simpl but ecolog harm project and decis of state organ and the requir of addit expenditur prevent the implement of the ecolog project the joint struggl against these phenomena and the accumul experi and inform alreadi in thi period promot special of the movement and formul of comprehens altern technic project project of the six section of voop and the power engin project of novosibirsk pamyat but all these project also remain unreal when they ran up against the sociopolit structur of industri bureaucrat societi the de ideolog of the ecolog movement more and more becam an anachron in 1989 it provok more and more seriou conflict the accept of novosibirsk pamyat into soe caus a multitud of protest by it member despit the lack of ecolog claim against thi organ the attempt to reconcil the entir polit spectrum from patriot to anarchist within the framework of the ecolog movement prove increasingli hopeless a new stage of the ecolog movement began thi stage can be call populist 1989 1991 it first symptom were reveal dure the 1989 elect campaign when the ecolog movement support candid who advanc ecolog slogan the politic of the ecolog movement and the move by most ecolog organ to open opposit to the cpsu by 1990 requir the promot of a polit idea which would not split the uniti of the activist who were assembl in them thi idea wa found most quickli in the union republ here the idea of protect the environ and the cultur legaci wa quickli combin with the idea of nation resurrect and then independ the acceler onset of the populist stage in republ strive for independ the baltic republ georgia and in part armenia start in 1988 account for thi a coincid of factor of the petit and populist period as well as the geograph compact of the territori result in a sharp increas in the size of the ecolog movement in these republ and their rapid integr into unifi system and later the recognit of their independ social interest such process also occur in the ukrain where they initi were not so clearli express but even here the chernobyl catastroph stimul an upsurg and rapid politic of the ecolog movement but in russia the nation factor which promot the upsurg of the ecolog movement in 1982 1986 did not play a signific role in most organ after thi for variou reason the mass conscious of the polit activ strata of the popul reject chauvinist and near chauvinist idea the guilt complex of a larg peopl reinforc by most of the intelligentsia made the abstract democrat idea foremost a larg part of the ecolog movement accept thi idea after the gener democrat polit movement move to open opposit to the regim the rel slow format of the ecolog movement s sociopolit postur allow gener democrat group to take over as leader of the ecologist and integr the ecologist activist into their own make up the idea that western form of civil would provid full salvat which domin in the conscious of the social activ popul infatu the ecolog movement too dure thi period the exampl of the western countri which had dealt with ecolog problem in their own home seem convinc proof of the ecolog effect of privat properti and parliamentari democraci the concern of the leader of democrat russia about expand the elector base promot the inclus of abstractli formul ecolog demand and promis to help shut down the most danger instal in elect program of the democrat candid as a result most ecolog movement support the democrat russia candid in elect and identifi hope for solv ecolog problem with their victori and the defeat of the cpsu onli a minor of ecolog group abstain in 1990 from support the elect campaign of the democrat but for variou reason a certain number of the group were inclin to support the patriot also preserv wa the fundament apolit tendenc which dure thi period larg coincid with the democrat orient polit for politician and ecolog for ecologist but deep within the populist ecolog movement with it orient to support prestigi polit leader new trend were matur trend which were an altern to popul and inclin to formul an independ sociopolit postur an altern both to the western and to the communist patriot orient thi rel new phenomenon in the ecolog movement wa relat to the movement to creat a green parti the appear of group which warn that hope place on liber who had come out of the cpsu were fals and which propos a philosophi of seek an altern to the contemporari industri societi presag a new crisi in the ecolog movement thi crisi did not delay in burst out after the democrat came to power in sever citi and on the parliamentari level in russia the mass move of the nomenklatura to democrat banner and the decommun of the cpsu put the question of chang to freer form of the market and western polit form on the agenda the democrat came to power and had to begin pay debt includ ecolog debt but the ecologist suddenli encount process which were directli opposit their expect in 1990 1991 the democrat administr fundament revis their attitud toward ecolog problem one of the clearest exampl wa the refus of the moscow leadership to freez construct of the northern tet central heat and power plant the econom troubl which had broken out dure thi period made it possibl to set a new theoret base under thi polici the mass inform media tri to convinc the popul that ecolog problem should be solv after econom one thi same idea wa the basi of the 500 day program support by the major of the democrat camp a larg number of the newli elect deputi set former ecolog demand asid the western orient of foreign polici and econom tie more and more clearli mark the prospect for turn the countri into an import of industri and radioact wast the new econom relat did not lessen but on the contrari intensifi the plunder of natur resourc and violat of ecolog standard the rapid chang in the posit of the democrat leader on the question of ecolog had a demor effect on the ecolog movement some of the movement s activist convinc themselv that the argument of the oppon of ecolog prioriti were right without an independ construct program they continu to follow former polit leader some ecologist were profoundli disappoint in the result of their social activ and drew the conclus that it wa hopeless to oppos industri expans some were poorli inform of the chang which had occur and continu to trust in victori democraci all these factor caus a mark declin in the ecolog movement the collaps of mani organ and a decreas in the number of member remain at the same time howev the unfold of ecolog disast togeth with the democrat camp s more and more obviou respons for it help gradual increas the influenc in the ecolog movement of organ orient toward an altern social program theori of anarch began to acquir a great deal of influenc in the ecolog milieu the activ particip of anarchist in ecolog work promot thi but the emerg of an altern movement in the populist period wa pain run up against both the old tradit form in the ecolog movement and grow pain the movement in support of creat a green parti emerg in decemb 1988 it had exist under thi name sinc 1989 but the parti itself wa proclaim onli in march 1990 the develop of the parti in 1990 1991 wa accompani by split the collaps and emerg of organ and the lack of workabl interregion structur most ecolog activist shun the parti green and their ideolog suspect the altern advoc of a desir to subordin the movement to themselv on the one hand and to split the democrat camp on the other at the same time howev the search for an altern ideolog wa fraught with intern clash relat to the ideolog differ of the author of the differ theori of ecolog polici the situat chang in 1992 which signal a new period in the develop of the ecolog movement thi period may be call the altern the reform of 1992 and the absenc of the etern culprit in the

until 1992 also found their own ecolog nich in societi and a commerci and polit base all thi creat the prerequisit for a new upsurg in the ecolog movement in 1992 although thi upsurg doe not promis such quantit growth in ecolog movement as in 1988 1989 the influenc of the green on social process in 1992 1993 may prove to be more substanti than befor despit these new phenomena in the milieu of the ecolog movement the scope of chang must not be exagger develop is occur unevenli the histori of the develop of the ecolog movement determin the extrem divers of it form in order to simplifi the

situat is natur but for ecolog organ to appear an alarm ecolog situat is not yet suffici strictli speak even the controversi soviet ecolog standard are violat practic everywher a certain level of polit sophist and an absenc of author who destroy the organ of opposit are need as a result the largest number of ecolog movement and most wide branch system took shape in the baltic republ ukrain armenia georgia a number of oblast of russia chelyabinsk tomsk and nezhegorodskiy for exampl and some metropolitan area st petersburg moscow nizhniy novgorod novosibirsk and other small ecolog group

even whole settlement is also tie to thi organ depend on state econom organ usual arous suspicion in the ecolog milieu too an organ s effect is determin abov all by perform of those task which it set for itself in the ecolog movement small caus and the formul of global social project are equal valuabl from the standpoint of intern divis of labor in the milieu of ecolog activist while in the first stage the greatest respect in the ecolog movement went to organ with larg number of member which were abl to shut down enterpris later the weight of polit influenti organ grew after the size of the ecolog movement declin the activ of member and their organiz and propagandist talent becam especi import an organ s work area depend on the region s problem and the ideolog of the group s leader and the presenc in that group of specialist on the particular problem among the work area typic of the ecolog movement we should singl out the struggl to shut down harm product facil and to particip in

method doe not enjoy great popular although it ha certain admir in the rainbow keeper organ for exampl some organ special in a small set of method but most prefer to vari them broadli typic of the ecolog movement are two directli opposit trend of develop from the lack of special and work in all area to concentr of effort on a narrow group of problem and the opposit from special to global approach to ecolog problem natur the special and global of the later period for the most part differ qualit from similar phenomena of earlier origin and special and univers group which have gone through a long evolut are usual distinguish by much greater construct than group which have appear recent the transfer of the experi of old group to new one is also possibl of cours thi is accompani by the passag of activist who have experi in public not necessarili ecolog activ to the new group the problem of the transfer and accumul of experi in the ecolog movement is close relat to the process of develop of variou ideolog trend in it a certain number of ecolog organ are orient to comprehens philosoph system christian rerikh s teach and origin theori but in most of them the share of view is not so comprehens as wa alreadi said predomin until 1991 were deliber de ideolog initi befor the 1989 elect even extern apolit popul abstract of unifi slogan and gener democrat view whose sens consist in a western orient of conscious and select of democrat symbol like multiparti system parliament and market despit the preval of these direct alreadi in 1988 1989 virtual the entir ideolog palett of the ecolog movement had been form patriot orient group evolv toward the idea of ethnocraci the need to establish polit privileg for the nativ nation ethnocrat group are oper in the ecolog movement of st petersburg krasnoyarsk and novosibirsk in 1992 the advoc of ethnocrat view made an unsuccess attempt to extend their influenc to the russian green parti the sharpli neg reaction of the parti to the attempt to organ a patriot faction in it make up show that even in a moder version patriot idea are vigor reject in the ecolog milieu conserv ideolog which sometim character itself as patriot in the origin mean of thi word is more widespread despit the fact that the holder of these view are not organ within the framework of the ecolog movement they are fairli larg in number a conserv orient of think correspond to the ecolog movement s orient to protect the natur and cultur environ liber democrat and social democrat view remain the most widespread polit ideolog in the ecolog movement a legaci to the movement from previou develop democrat ideolog is supplement in the ecolog milieu with greater attent to ecolog and social protect liber democrat ideolog predomin in the democrat parti of green of chelyabinsk oblast the largest of the green parti democrat view of variou hue predomin in the mass of member of other green parti too respect ecolog movement and green parti of the west which fight to protect the environ without question the foundat of western societi are the usual model for the democrat ecologist to imit at the same time howev the cost of western in countri which were part of the ussr promot an evolut of the bearer of democrat ideolog toward socialist anarchist and conserv view but thi process ha just begun the weak of the democrat polici promot the support of state socialist communist view in the ecolog milieu too but the cpsu s respons for the destruct of the environ in the recent past make the state social of certain ecologist more of a die phenomenon differ direct of nonstat social and anarch are becom much more popular among ecologist the reject of the state as a mechan for solv social problem by these trend is in keep with ecolog critic of the destruct of the environ by the depart thi initi area for cooper becom upon further examin supplement by deeper correspond both the green and the anarchist favor the prioriti of local interest over statewid one preserv of the environ from outsid expans is the task of ecologist which incit them against the state s central bureaucraci a consist ecolog approach also presuppos reject of the industri organ of product the main sourc of industri expans against the natur environ as a construct antithesi to the industri system base on total control anarch suggest self govern and decentr of the economi includ technolog decentr thi in turn is in keep with the prefer which ecologist give to small scale product rather than industri giant the particip of anarchist in the ecolog movement from the moment anarchist organ were restor in the ussr from the begin promot allianc relat between them and ecologist and then the interpenetr of anarchist and ecolog organ as the latter were politic the divers of anarchist organ from left socialist to anarchist communist and the complic relat with them were also reflect in the develop of the politic ecolog movement the conflict of the syndicalist and communist in anarch were especi notic dure the format of the green parti which as a result split into the russian green parti rpg in which the support of market relat the syndicalist anarchist commun socialist have great influenc and the green parti leagu lzp whose initi belong to the ecosocialist communist anarchist trend which oppos market mechan of cours the conflict between the anarchist were not the onli but mere one of the reason for the split in the green parti which had appear befor it time in the populist period but the particip of politic group which had alreadi undergon lengthi polit evolut and gain the correspond experi in event relat to the split help acceler the polit evolut into manhood of the ecolog movement which rel quickli pass through the inevit period of intern ideolog conflict split occur in the milieu of the green parti earlier and less pain than could have been expect in the event of autark develop of the politic ecolog movement as a result the politic ecolog movement wa abl to overcom the most acut intern conflict befor the alternativist stage involv the mass politic of ecologist began it is signific that it wa precis the anarchist who clash among themselv in 1991 who help normal relat between the rpz and the lzp the veri fact of a demarc into differ organ help reduc the intern tension which exist in the gener but amorph organ the distribut of ecolog organ across the polit spectrum and the quantit predomin of gener democrat cadr help consolid effort of politic ecologist into the struggl against common enemi onli in relat to ethnocrat organ do most ecolog organ continu to be split an organ s ideolog and the time when it emerg determin the structur composit initi as a rule amorph group and tradit democrat organ with an elect leadership and broad
