languag f p 105 lithuanian f articl type bfn f p 106 articl by broniu genz legisl deputi and member f of the lithuanian democrat labor parti the negat of the state excerpt the overal destruct of the state is go on in lithuania the press is wage an intens propaganda war against all govern structur without except the seima parliament the presid court and self govern it seem that no posit chang have occur sinc the restor of independ in lithuania thi idea is be promot on all level from the 16 februari independ day to the leftist opposit refer to right and left radic forc the reader is be persuad that lithuanian are immatur for their statehood they vote for god know who most of them support those who do not deserv support and so on the suprem evil is the seima formerli the suprem council which is compos of foolish and avid deputi money assign for it mainten is wast it follow from these specul that elect are an unnecessari wast of financ and that lithuania doe not need elect bodi wa it better when stranger rule us might the nation need a leader like the one landsbergi offer at the 23 may 1992 referendum sinc citizen did not grant him unlimit power should not they put him in thi post in some other way i am convinc that some of these propagandist do not even consid what they are propos to the nation anoth target of critic is the nation defens system is everyth so black there as well a campaign is be wage against the nation defens ministri kam and the volunt nation defens servic skat some peopl have a great temptat to bring the first organ of our militari structur to the bar paper are publish an increas number of articl expos our armi everyth is bad there the armi is arbitrari and corrupt we must understand howev whi we have such a situat and look for way of improv it i would like to ask the current kam critic where were you earlier and what wa your role in creat militari structur could our arm forc albeit imperfect emerg on anoth basi when our countri had no intern recognit no state could legal support us with arm if some countri had tri to do thi openli it would have been condemn for interfer in intern affair the illeg arm trade is a dirti busi it is often link with the crimin world histori doe not know ani group fight for it countri s independ which ha not tri to acquir arm illeg while there is no legal way therefor crimin charg can alway be brought against them later for the illeg acquisit of arm passag omit while lithuania wa not intern recogn it wa danger to work in it militari structur particularli without arm there were no possibl then to check everi person come to the defens system and find out where he or she had bought their arm crimin usual take advantag of such situat the suprem council secur depart the skat and the nation defens depart later the kam emerg dure the event of januari 1991 there is no wonder that ordinari hooligan and thiev also found themselv there due to the lack of control i am sure that the russian secret servic inspir mani of them to join these structur these servic must have infiltr their agent into our origin militari structur i think that these peopl have not disappear unfortun we know littl about their network howev thi is onli one side of the moon what about the other kam and skat politician of that time would impart hatr toward their own countrymen with differ view rather than foreign invad they seem to see enemi around everi corner i think that the futur will expos those who spread hatr and their goal on the other hand our militari command did not allow themselv to be involv in polit intrigu they accept the result of both the 23 may 1992 referendum and the octob seima elect even though some peopl want to annul them the staff of kam skat and the suprem council secur depart behav properli dure those elect polit toler and respons wa come into be power wa be smoothli transfer from one polit group to anoth our militari command did everyth to prevent georgian type develop in our countri passag omit certainli we must protect our militari structur from further corrupt howev financi violat in the past and the present are two differ thing if we continu to bluntli attack the kam we will either set the armi against us or impart an inferior complex to our soldier which would be ruinou to the state in either case summar these observ one can draw the conclus that there are two group of peopl interest in discredit kam and skat 1 those who fail to use militari structur for their egoist interest 2 the enemi of our independ who would like lithuania not to have even a symbol forc that could resist attempt to suppress our state let us consid the follow synchron event as soon as the extern pressur increas the intern opposit from the pole union to the nationalist parti becom activ both these organ are extrem nationalist it would be understand if they engag in cultur issu i do not think that these small organ could rais a big commot all by themselv for exampl the vilniu region council guid by the pole union is step up pressur on lithuanian school such step are noth but provoc there are mani former enemi of lithuania s independ in thi union therefor it is clear whi lithuanian citizen look upon thi organ with suspicion at the same time the nationalist are shout about new elect the overthrow of the govern and so on thi forc one to consid which group are interest in lithuania s unstabl situat and bring one to the conclus that there are three such forc oper in our countri the first forc is the support of the restor of the russian empir they want to discredit the veri idea of lithuania s statehood and persuad the world commun as well as the lithuanian themselv that lithuania is immatur for it independ therefor they are dissemin the follow idea abroad former communist have return to power chao poverti and theft reign the countri it is danger for foreign to stay here longer there is no order in the countri or that lithuania is capabl of export onli cheap prostitut to the west thu there remain noth els but to return to the embrac of the russian empir the second forc is the construct opposit it singl goal is to return to power by ani mean without know what to do after that although thi group is tri to discredit lithuania s current govern alon actual it contribut to ruin not onli govern institut but also the state itself the third forc is the mafia which is complet it integr with the intern crimin world mafia structur do not care about the color of the govern they seek to creat corrupt author incap of control the countri s economi the syndrom of a banana republ in realiti even though they do not seek thi subject the latter two group serv the first one i am sure that the first forc ha a network of it agent in the second two and it can control the latter s action through such measur destabil the situat in the countri as necessari passag omit
