topic that are base on that strategi then becaus there are also field of health scienc that involv bioethic safeti and other such delic problem the health scienc confer were set up in novemb 1986 as round tabl discuss with the minist of health and welfar at the confer the expert opinion of knowledg and experienc peopl are solicit and it is appropri to aim for a public consensu type of format sinc the first meet in novemb 1986 discuss have been held at the health scienc confer on issu such as the basic mid and long term strategi for promot health scienc prioriti research topic that will continu into the futur how health scienc research should be evalu and so forth in septemb 1988 a report entitl for the establish of a basi and breakthrough in health scienc research wa compil as the mid and
