and an import mean of implement kyrgyzstan s new energi polici the primari goal of it subsequ acceler develop is to maxim particip in standard and then subsequ greater improv the live condit of the popul thi will call for expand the use of electr power in everyday life and the sphere of social servic the second object of acceler the develop of electrif is to enhanc it particip in increas the product sphere effici and increas the nation econom resourc which result in invigor the republ s economi it is expect that industri electr power consumpt will continu to decreas in 1993 1994 in addit to the declin volum of electr power gener a continu increas in the electr power cost which stimul an increas in the electr power consumpt effici will also have their impact the economi is expect to pick up eventu and some of it will be due to an increas in the electr power to worker ratio which will lead to an increas in electr power consumpt nevertheless a rather moder rate of industri electr power consumpt growth is predict allow for energi conserv furthermor the proport of industri in the total electr power demand will decreas from 37 2 in 1992 to 29 in 2005 roughli the same trend will character the electr power consumpt for agricultur need at the level of 2 000 thi categori of user will consum one fifth of the total electr power demand in the republ the anticip substanti shift in the electr power consumpt structur will occur due to a deliber acceler develop of electrif of the daili life of the popul by implement energi intens heat applianc in resid a stage by stage increas in the number of such heat applianc will be respons for an increas in the proport of domest thermal process in the total electr power consumpt of up to 20 30 after 2000 at the same time the electr power consumpt for tradit household need will also increas thi electr power consumpt is tent estim as 11 8 billion kwh in 1995 and 17 4 billion kwh in 2000
