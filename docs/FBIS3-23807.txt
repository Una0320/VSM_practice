unlik to be achiev arutyunyan add up what the steam from the boiler hous will cost the enterpris and how much transport cost would be the bottom line is that there is no way to make end meet and the enterpris cannot afford to oper at a loss what make it even more pain for the director to suffer through inact and lack of prospect is that he ha at hi dispos state of the art equip as well as highli

calcul the minimum wage in armenia is 110 dram the averag wage is 250 dram the differ between them howev much as between pension and allow on one hand and the presid s salari on the other is not that tangibl price are out of reach in relat to ani local incom with the level of price and the exchang rate 100 dram correspond to approxim one dollar that is most peopl here have a monthli incom in the

dram champaign 800 a pack of cigarett between 10 astra and 60 magna dram a tube of toothpast 100 a bar of household soap 50 and 10 egg 100 dram so after deduct apart rent and the cost of public

servic minist ashot esayan told us how meticul thi work is perform he also told us that late hi staff have begun to uncov instanc of fictiti divorc for the purpos of claim singl mother benefit charit aid come to armenia through variou channel also is concentr in thi ministri and distribut by it thi is not an easi task not onli becaus there is not enough for everyon but also becaus commun with the outsid world are difficult for instanc they receiv a shipment of kerosen cooker from the unit state but have not been abl to get the accompani kerosen out of batimu howev even moral support is of great signific here here by the way is the account number where monetari aid may be sent yerevan myasnikyanskiy state commerci bank 141 635 h5 not onli unhappi famili are unhappi in their own way h5 one cannot explain armenia s current troubl by the preponder or the legaci of the parti nomenklatura it member have been long remov from power and the reform and democrat initi proceed here without delay and aggress redistribut of land and decollectiv for instanc were implement earlier and on a larger scale than in other former union republ but first an earthquak and then karabakh the confront with azerbaijan and then destabil in neighbor georgia becam factor that overrod everyth els separ from the rubl zone ha affect armenia more pain than other the nation currenc the dram is not becom a full fledg currenc and is hamper opportun both for enterpris and commerci trader is a free market and liber in the economi possibl at all in thi situat would it not be more logic as some opposit member suggest to go the opposit way tighten the administr rein and central all resourc and distribut channel no armenian prime minist grant bagratyan told us even in these condit a market economi is much more viabl expens as food is it is still avail and onli becaus the main landown is the privat farmer rather than kolkhoz we are now begin privat in other econom sphere as well we will stop the product declin as to the dram s exchang rate in relat to the dollar we have alreadi stabil it of cours the situat in gener is so hard for the populac that peopl s attitud toward the govern in these circumst cannot be posit it is hard to be love in these condit the rate of the govern and of the presid ha drop percept late mani peopl who just recent were the presid s ardent support now critic him sharpli peopl are irrit both by the optim frequent display by the prime minist and the extrem reserv in forecast that ha been late characterist of the presid how could levon say someth like thi on new year s eve we heard more than onc as if it is not enough that famili had such a meager holiday meal on the tabl then the presid ad insult to injuri by say that it may get wors how can it get ani wors while there is a percept shift in societi s attitud toward the presid and the govern despit the fact that there are no seriou altern forc in sight becaus the room for maneuv in polit and econom is too small when it come to the question of karabakh the posit remain the same and quit unshak nobodi here question the fight to take nagorno karabakh from azerbaijan and the solidar with karabakh armenian remain across the board and sincer armenian minist of defens serzh sarkisyan is a civilian a philologist by educ he fought in karabakh howev and ha a reput as a talent militari command he reassert to us that the armenian armi is not engag in combat oper but it is unthink to leav karabakh resid without support by the way hi own wife and children live in stepanakert there is one more point on which probabl all parti movement and all strata of societi agre the necess to strengthen tie with russia the hope for russian aid mani are inclin to ideal the situat in russian polit and the economi the differ in the standard of live and the stabil of the two countri currenc is just too great h5 how long can one keep push a trolley bu h5 peasant are today on much more solid ground than urban resid we saw proof of thi in artashatskiy rayon as everywher in armenia land here is mostli divid among individu owner all in all there are more than 300 000 privat farm in the countri consider more than in immens russia these farm are small between one and 10 hectar howev for such tradit sector as viticultur and horticultur thi size is optim despit the high cost of fuel fertil and manufactur feed concentr as well as the gener econom crisi harvest yield are high the yield of potato last year for instanc amount to 420 000 tonn a record over the past 10 year the declin in the size of livestock herd ha been halt the problem right now is not product but distribut of agricultur output in the same artashatskiy rayon for instanc which is locat quit close to yerevan it is still too costli for peasant to bring produc for sale in the capit thi is precis whi as minist of agricultur ashot voskanyan told us the ministri also shift from product manag to organ servic for peasant distribut their output and price polici one way or the other at least the countrysid feed itself well onli a small part of the republ s popul live there howev most live in yerevan and other major citi but privat farm s potenti is suffici to provid for all urban resid and not onli with respect to foodstuff thi is quit notic if one look at enterpris process local agricultur output director of the aygorg rug factori eduard agadzhanov told us that sinc decollectiv to thi day the problem of wool procur ha ceas to be a problem for him altogeth privat supplier are much more reliabl and provid better qualiti than state supplier there is a score of enterpris of complet differ special that have been abl to find for themselv a way out of the incred difficult condit and develop product the bazalt defens plant is set up product of trolley buse and furnitur the famou ararat cognac factori is expand it distribut market bakeri plant no 4 ha doubl the output of bread nevertheless the declin in the armenian economi is seriou and pain it is not easi to get reliabl statist in thi respect in armenia itself some data are classifi other differ tremend from one anoth or are frankli unrealist accord to expert of the moscow center sovecon the pictur look like thi accord to preliminari estim the gross domest product for last year will amount to onli 38 percent of the 1990 level while in russia for instanc it will amount to 57 6 percent in neighbor azerbaijan 48 percent and in the ci as a whole 55 5 percent the volum of industri product 30 5 percent in agricultur 55 percent and in construct 20 percent in all other indic armenia is also consider behind both russia and the ci meanwhil outsid the gate of even rel well to do enterpris there are street with veri few car becaus gasolin is veri expens street down which where one see peopl drag bundl of firewood and brushwood here and there one get a glimps of a scene that would be incomprehens for instanc to a muscovit passeng are push a trolley bu and onli thi way get through what is quit often a consider part of the rout go through a microrayon where the electr ha been turn off to an area where there is light
