object and lay a solid foundat for achiev our third strateg object base on the strateg three step deploy of china s econom construct and in accord with the trend and current of intern s amp t develop make comprehens arrang for the develop of scienc and technolog for the next 10 to 30 year is an import histor task 2 in the past 40 year china s s amp t activ have made world famou achiev china now ha 10 9 million natur scienc and technolog personnel includ 1 05 million who are involv in research and develop we have over 5 000 independ research and develop organ and there are over 7 000 r amp d organ under the jurisdict of enterpris they have form a rel complet s amp t system that ha made sever world recogn major s amp t achiev china ha reli mainli on it own forc to solv mani import s amp t problem in econom construct nation defens and social develop thi is particularli true of the past 10 plu year of reform and open up when china ha readjust it s amp t develop principl and made breakthrough advanc in reform of the s amp t system organ attack on key s amp t problem extend s amp t achiev spur s amp t progress in rural area promot develop of high and new tech industri strengthen intern s amp t cooper and exchang and other area 3 dure the cours of develop s amp t work for more than 40 year we have accumul rich experi and mani lesson our main experi are one s amp t work must adher to leadership of the communist parti and to the socialist road two adher to reform and open up while perfect plan manag we have strengthen the role of market regul acceler the transfer of s amp t achiev into product and promot the integr of s amp t with the economi on the basi of independ and make our own decis we have activ absorb advanc experi and s amp t achiev from foreign countri and acceler the develop of s amp t in china three under the unifi leadership of the state we have concentr manpow and materi to organ attack on major s amp t task in nation econom construct and social develop four while foster the backbon role of our special s amp t staff we have been concern with integr special scientif research work and mass technic innov and integr lead cadr with s

ideolog and actual work in econom and social develop have not alway put promot of s amp t progress in an import strateg posit two econom develop lack mechan and intern motiv forc for reli on s amp t progress s amp t develop lack vital in orient toward econom construct and larg number of technic achiev cannot be convert into forc of product which ha result in a certain degre of detach of s amp t from econom and social develop and an inabl to fulli foster the potenti of scienc and technolog third in s amp t work there is a lack of unifi arrang and a ration divis of labor as well as the univers exist of repeat problem at low level the phenomena of detach from our nation condit blindli push forward and catch up and press urgent for achiev have also occur at time four major error have occur in polici toward intellectu that have damag the initi and creativ of s amp t personnel and affect the healthi growth of our s amp t staff a social climat of respect knowledg and respect skill personnel ha not been form 4 s amp t work must be orient toward modern toward the world and toward the futur today s new s amp t revolut that is develop in a burgeon manner in the world ha caus s amp t to permeat everi realm of human societi in an unpreced way which ha spur an enorm takeoff of the social forc of product and engend profound chang in the configur of the world the degre to which econom and social develop in each countri is depend on s amp t progress is increas overlap and intersect of basic research appli research and technolog develop ha appear schedul for convert technic achiev into commod product have continu shorten and the relationship among s amp t educ and product are becom closer look toward the world s s amp t develop over the next 10 to 30 year major breakthrough will happen in sever emerg s amp t field and new product technolog and new understand of natur phenomena will have profound impact on the develop of human societi the develop of high and new technolog will further transform the face of exist industri and becom a major factor in world econom competit the world s econom develop and s amp t progress are now move toward internation and s amp t competit is increasingli becom a decis factor in intern econom competit at the same time mankind must strengthen intern cooper to solv global problem like popul the environ resourc disast and so on that it face in common no countri can achiev modern in a close state 5 china s s amp t develop must begin with our nation condit china ha a larg popul a weak foundat and underdevelop social forc of product some 80 percent of our popul live in rural area and we will remain in the initi stage of social for a rather long period of histori into the futur china s econom and social develop is face restrict by our popul resourc environ and other factor our popul ha alreadi surpass 1 1 billion and even if we strictli control it rate of growth it will still grow to 1 5 billion by the 2020 s although china ha rather abund total amount of most resourc they are rel insuffici in term of per capita amount of resourc compar to the world averag we have one third the per capita cultiv land area one fourth the freshwat resourc one fifth the afforest area and onli one half the energi resourc environment pollut and ecolog destruct alreadi constitut seriou threat to our econom and social develop for a long time china ha been reli on the consumpt of larg amount of resourc to develop our economi technolog and manag in most industri are backward the qualiti of product is poor and econom result are low china is one of the world s nation have the highest amount of energi consum per unit valu of output and social labor product is equival to onli about 5 percent of advanc world level in the final analysi these discrep are discrep in s amp t level educ level and manag level if we still lack a sens of crisi and urgenc and do not do everyth we can to catch up the discrep will not shrink and they may even expand the object of china s socialist modern and construct will be in danger of fall through and we will not have the place in the world that we should have 6 the key to modern our nation economi and significantli rais labor product is modern of scienc and technolog we must certainli foster to the greatest possibl extent the role of s amp t as the first forc of product respect knowledg and skill personnel and more conscious shift econom construct onto the track of reli on s amp t progress and improv the qualiti of labor thi import decis is an indic of an histor chang in china s s amp t econom and social develop strategi and is import for achiev our goal of struggl for the remaind of thi centuri and into the next one look toward the futur we must have a sober understand of the seriou situat look more toward the favor factor and confid meet the challeng we now have substanti s amp t forc that have gain mani success experi even more import is that 10 year of reform and open up have brought vigor and vital to our econom and s amp t develop if we just conscienti adher to the parti s basic line fulli foster the role of s amp t as the first forc of product inspir enthusiasm
