view on the futur and the direct thing are move as well as what is be refer to as the new world order what is the outlook at the close of the 20th centuri and to what extent can economi and technolog affect thi situat rowhani if we want to compar our current posit in the region and in the world with our past posit i should say that the islam republ of iran is the manifest of a well establish and strong countri and that it can be count on sinc it is a countri that remain steadfast on it holi revolutionari islam and nation aspir at a time when some countri chang their face each day each hour and each month but the islam republ of iran ha shown that throughout the past 14 to 15 year it ha been abl to withstand all vicissitud the world ha realiz that we are steadfast in our holi principl and aspir also we are faith to our promis and our friendship with countri toward which we have extend our hand probabl some countri are unabl to act with the same sincer when they are a target of onslaught but the islam republ of iran ha shown that it doe not fear such tempest in their extens propaganda the enemi of the islam republ of iran portray iran as a countri seek an opportun to commit aggress against other countri and a countri seek to interfer in the domest affair of other but incid dure the past few year have fulli proven how baseless thi propaganda is the islam republ of iran is neither an aggressor and opportunist nor is it seek expansionist object and it is steadfast in the principl that it ha declar iran s patient and friendli attitud toward the develop in afghanistan which ha recent achiev it independ may have been probabl surpris for the world howev despit it extens border with afghanistan iran did not interven in ani way onli the envoy of the islam republ of iran ran from one street to anoth amid fire and blood tri to establish a ceasefir and not to allow the flame of war to engulf the parti and group in that countri some of our diplomat were wound in thi process and some even face the danger of be martyr even in the difficult day when mani peopl left kabul the polit envoy of the islam republ of iran stay on the same situat is true in our neighbor countri to the north in the azerbaijani armenian incid and in tajikistan the islam republ of iran show that it doe what it say in the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia the islam republ of iran ha alway tri to be a good mediat and to extinguish the flame of the war it ha never tri to exploit the situat in the sens that it ha never pursu it own interest the iraqi case is a clearer exampl thi wa a case of a countri that had fought against us for eight year a countri that had perpetr a seri of crime against our nation and a countri that confront kuwait which had commit so much treason against our peopl dure the iran iraq war but iran accept refuge from both countri with open arm we accept about 1 2 or 1 3 million iraqi and ten of thousand of kuwaiti when all border delin had been upset there were no border and we had a free hand to do what we want but we did not enter iraq i think that the incid and develop that took place around us make all those in the world who are clever and calcul despit the propaganda that they dissemin against us realiz the truth i think that in recent year the islam republ of iran ha fulli proven it islam and humanitarian natur to the world i consid the posit of the islam republ of iran in the world to be extrem good all the hue and cri start by the american cannot convinc their friend to sever their relat with iran or to stop help iran thi is import and more import still we see how under such condit when all thi commot is go on against the islam republ of iran europ japan and other have healthi polit and econom relat with the islam republ of iran it is onli natur for them not to want to leav a countri that want to live independ under the current world condit and a third world countri in such a sensit area of the world at that to be in peac but fortun dure the past 14 to 15 year we have shown that we are complet resist and that we are veri use to plot and to thwart and confront such plot other too have come to know us veri well of cours i think that thi is the first time in histori that the world is see iran as it is today befor thi iran wa alway known as a countri that wa outwardli independ but inwardli under the domin of other and it wa either the british the russian or the american who domin it but the fulli independ face of the islam republ of iran is a face that wa seen after the victori of the islam revolut and it wa the face of uniti in the religi and polit manag of the countri until the victori of the islam revolut and especi dure the pahlavi dynasti these two manag were alway in confront dure the qajar and safavid dynasti the situat wa differ in other word at some junctur in histori there ha been a close between these two manag but dure the pahlavi dynasti the polit manag wa in total confront with the religi manag the revolut wa the first time that the countri had wit the uniti of these two and thi is extrem import sinc we see that the same person who is the polit head of the countri is also the religi head in other word the issu of the suprem leader is an extrem signific issu that ha been stabil in our countri and that our peopl have wholeheartedli and sincer accept the west think that iranian accept imam khomeyni but that they do not accept the suprem leader howev thing were later clarifi and the world saw that the iranian accept both imam khomeyni and the suprem leader today therefor a suprem leader will alway exist imam khomeyni may hi soul be sanctifi stood out at one time in histori and we benefit from the light that he shed of cours we will alway make use of the moral light that the late leader shed on us but hi physic presenc wa onli for a while howev a suprem leader will alway exist therefor the unit manag in the islam countri ha given the islam world the opportun for the ruler to stand next to the peopl passag omit whether the world want it or not the islam republ of iran rule the heart of the peopl throughout the world thi is not like the alleg world leadership of america which accept onli itself the american alleg leadership but they are the onli one who accept thi it ha been prove that they are not the leader of the world but that the islam republ of iran is undoubtedli the leader of million throughout the world and it doe not make ani differ if these countri are near us or not our influenc in countri far from us is bigger than our influenc on our neighbor countri the influenc that we have in algeria over the heart of the peopl in egypt despit their distanc from us and the influenc that we have on muslim in the far east in africa and in the american contin may be greater than the influenc that we have on muslim in our neighbor countri therefor thi is a moral and genuin influenc thi is in answer to the first part of your question on how we should view the islam republ of iran at thi junctur in histori i think that iran should be regard as a power as an independ countri as a countri where religion and polit and peopl and offici are in full coordin as a countri that doe not intend to commit aggress as a peac seek countri as a countri that doe not intend to occupi anoth countri as a countri that is fulli faith to it aspir and slogan and as a countri whose word can be trust today there is no other countri but iran in the world that portray such a pictur in answer to the second part of your question on how we see the world and the new world order i think that we should expect mani develop in the come year it may seem that differ stem from the exist of two superpow in the world may have end and that it is the era of a new order where there will no longer be a threat of war and where peac and justic will reign but thi is not so in other word we have not onli not seen a reduct in region war and clash but we have also seen the occup of one countri by anoth dure thi era of the new order in other word it wa dure the era of the new order that iraq attack devour and annex anoth countri if thi new order did not exist such thing might never have happen we may not have had the war that we see in europ today a clear exampl of which is bosnia herzegovina as well as the ethnic war that we have wit it is not as though we can say that what we see today is a world of peac of tranquil and of a unipolar system none of these have been fulfil and i think that they will never be fulfil the incid in the soviet union as publish show the western that they cannot make a clear judgment of what will happen in that countri in the recent elect there we saw how those who put forth extrem ultranationalist slogan and spoke about the peopl s nation pride got a higher number of vote even though their slogan are danger the major of the peopl vote in favor of them the elect in the soviet union as publish were not a simpl issu it wa someth that may have complet shaken the west and made them realiz that they cannot be veri confid that the issu of a soviet superpow ha end onc and for all i think that new pole are be form in the world we see that the thought that in the new world order there would be onli one pole where the american would be abl to act as the world leader and do as they pleas ha not materi i think that in the come year and especi in the begin of the new centuri that you refer to we will wit mani rapid and import develop as to what element will play a role in these develop i can list technolog as one of the most import element of cours refer can also be made to economi but econom develop may also be the result of modern technolog the issu of technolog is extrem import in other word technolog develop may make countri superior to the current power and may lead to a complet chang in the world situat the world s militari situat may also chang becaus of technolog develop of cours there are other import element in the world i think that the most import element that can influenc the futur of the world is economi in it gener sens which also includ technolog and scienc and cultur which includ ideolog and religion other develop such as militari polit and social aspect will all be offshoot of these in today s world technolog and scientif develop are extrem rapid and awe inspir the same appli to cultur develop thi veri issu of the reviv of religi thought throughout the world is an extrem import issu the forecast in the world wa that by the end of the current centuri there would be no such thing as religion but today we see how at the end of thi centuri religi thought ha been reviv and how the situat now cannot be compar even with the situat at the begin of the current centuri we will definit wit the further expans of such develop in the next centuri i think that the basi of the world s futur develop will be economi and cultur and the american will not have the first say in either of these two field possibl as far as japan germani and so on are concern we can say that they will play the number one role in the futur economi but as far as cultur is concern we think that islam will be consid an extrem import and great cultur power becaus we are now wit the dawn of islam the ray of islam will undoubtedli spread in the next few year and at the begin of the new centuri we will wit new cultur develop under the aegi of these ray majl va pazhuhesh your excel s refer to technolog and econom develop call for discuss the fact that energi ha been gradual play a stronger role in geopolit develop for the past decad how do you assess thi element and how long do you think thi develop will last rowhani energi will play an extrem import role of cours a special period start in the world after 1973 thi period concentr on way to replac oil with other energi much work ha been done on thi and now 20 year later with the advanc technolog that man ha at hi dispos we should have wit mani rapid and profound develop but we have not moreov oil is now consid the commod that is the sourc of mani extens develop in the variou field now we even see that aircraft manufactur with composit preced word in english are stronger than aircraft manufactur with special steel therefor in the futur of industri and economi oil will maintain it special place i think that the situat that the west head by america ha creat for oil today is not onli treason against the oil export countri but treason against all mankind in other word we are offer the world s most valuabl commod which is also veri limit at extrem low price we are burn and destroy thi commod and thi is treason against the futur of mankind it is the american and the rest of the big western power who should be answer to histori for thi treason it is within the context of the signific of energi or of black gold that iran and basic speak the persian gulf find it special role it is becaus of thi role that in the come centuri mani of the countri that are not oil export will not onli not be export they will also have to becom import in the come decad it is possibl that there will not be a commod known as north sea oil of cours some opinion are that the north sea oil reserv will end much sooner possibl in the first year of the next centuri we will reach a situat in which not onli will the persian gulf be the sole export of oil in the world but saudi arabia too will be an oil superpow follow by other countri such as iran iraq kuwait and so on and will be abl to export oil and ga the largest ga resourc are in thi area perhap the increas presenc of foreign power and their arm in thi region is becaus of the energi issu but we should also be wise in preserv thi valuabl energi resourc the majl and the govern should make plan and not allow thi major asset to be wast we should have correct program at home the majl research center should studi way that we can econom in energi consumpt as far as the world is concern the energi problem and especi the problem of oil will undoubtedli not lose it import for year to come majl va pazhuhesh the esteem leader s emphasi on relat with america show that the system strongli reject polit relat with america from the point of view of slogan what polit and ideolog logic do you have to offer in justif of thi polici rowhani becaus of it histor ideolog and religi root the issu of america is of special import to our countri first of all when we look at histori we see that from it outset the islam revolut wa a struggl against foreign and specif american coloni in tandem with a struggl against domest coloni passag omit therefor we see that the struggl against america from the veri first year of thi movement wa the pivot and major slogan on the other hand the american too play a major role in crush the revolut we see how at the peak of the revolut the american gener huyser person came to iran in a bid to crush and to destroy the revolut of cours we knew all these thing at that time and the fact that the shah had plan engin by the american and especi aim at confront the revolut and islam ha becom clearer now in hi famou speech at the feyziyeh school which spark off the 1342 1963 movement and the 5 june 1963 incid hi emin the imam may hi soul be sanctifi told the shah don t do whatev the american dictat to you at least think and see what they are dictat to you therefor we see that thi movement which wa a struggl against america from the veri start led to the victori of the revolut after which the american embassi s plot start thi wa follow by the occup of the nest of espionag and the revel of document for the world to see how from the veri outset the american were work toward defeat the revolut and overthrow the system now too wherev there is a plot against iran against the system of the islam republ against the revolut and against the islam movement in the world be it in algeria egypt or anywher els where an islam movement is seen we see how the american play the main role in suppress it thu the issu of the peopl s enmiti with america is both a matter of histori and revolut and of slogan and religion the american have alway oppos islam thought and islam movement thi opposit and confront continu today too the imam may hi soul be sanctifi veri clearli specifi the pivot slogan of struggl against america of cours it is true that we did not sever our polit relat with america and that it wa the american who sever their relat with us but the imam state hi satisfact at thi what did we need these relat for in other word even though the american start everyth both the imam and the peopl welcom it throughout thi period the american have not decreas their enmiti even for one day they have frozen our asset but what we owe them compar with our frozen asset wa minim therefor the american have resort to variou mean to express their overt hostil toward us and when they have enter a war against us with such hostil feel what reason is there for us to propound the issu of relat with america in such an atmospher basic it is not correct to propound thi issu at all at thi junctur in histori i think that the esteem leader s remark on 4 novemb thi year the anniversari of the occup of the u s embassi were extrem sagaci he clearli state all the reason and logic behind hi view reason whi we should not establish relat with america have alway been list but it wa necessari to clarifi them and to give the reason whi our activ should be base on our nation and islam interest what benefit will our approach the unit state or our establish relat with it have it is extrem simplemind to think that our problem exist becaus we have no relat with america and that if we establish relat these problem would be solv undoubtedli in our relat with america we would suffer much harm and it cannot be proven that such relat would reap even one of the benefit that it is said they would yield especi with america s current foreign polici in the clinton era basic speak america s foreign polici is veri sick becaus of their mani blatant mistak and extrem childish behavior the secretari of state and the nation secur council of america are in a shaki posit the american do mani ridicul and childish thing and say that they want to behav with iran in the same way that they behav with the iraqi and that just as they exert pressur on iraq they will put pressur on iran say such thing is extrem childish and thoughtless and show that basic speak american foreign polici is sick and unabl to analyz world issu therefor at a time when america is our enemi and doe not hide it enmiti and at a time when our peopl have alway been harm and harass by america rapproch with america will definit be to our detriment the american violent treatment of a coupl of our navi offic on board iran ajr the down of the iranair airbu the destruct of the salman oil platform the taba incid and so on all speak of america s violent and pitiless action for us the american enmiti ha been obviou from the taba incid to the down of our plane and to it action today i think that the american are pitiless and illog enemi and that rapproch with them will definit be to our detriment moreov basic it is up to the esteem leader to delin and to determin the major and principl polici of the countri and the system and he ha veri explicitli state that we have noth to gain from relat with america and that such relat are harm to us i should also add that some peopl think that the entir world is friend with america and that the onli countri in the world that is america s enemi is the islam republ of iran or that all countri in the world are in love with america and that it is onli the islam republ of iran that detest it and with thi type of assess they ask how can america which is love by everyon be detest by you but i think that thi is not so america ha extrem strong militari econom ideolog and cultur enemi in the world and of cours at the top of the list of america s militari enemi despit everyth that is be said and despit the express of friendship is russia there are also china and franc from the econom aspect america confront japan and germani and from the ideolog and cultur aspect it is confront the islam republ of iran and revolutionari islam therefor we can say that the american have mani enemi all the nation in the world are the enemi of america the third world is america s enemi actual there are sever superpow that are confront america the militari superpow in the form of russia china and franc the econom superpow in the form of japan and germani and so on and the cultur superpow in the form of the islam republ therefor it is not as though everyon els except us is america s friend the tone that the other use may be differ from our they may speak in a diplomat manner or hide some of their intent but our posit is clear and explicit majl va pazhuhesh the truth is that the islam republ s foreign polici ha not fluctuat so much after the format of the suprem nation secur council snsc pleas tell us about the process that led to the creation and to the continu exist of thi council what role it play in variou develop and what it ha been abl to achiev rowhani i think that an institut known as the snsc is among the bless that were bestow on us with the latest direct that were issu by hi emin the imam may hi soul be sanctifi and which wa creat with the revis of the constitut actual mani countri feel the need for a nation secur council after a period of war or militari conflict dure the war we had a suprem nation defens council but we had to rapidli form anoth council known as the suprem war support council so that it could fill the vacuum that exist with the absenc of a nation secur council after the war the need for a central institut in which politician and militari offici could sit next to each other and adopt or coordin militari and polit decis wa tangibl felt on the other hand it wa necessari for the head of the three power to sit down togeth and to coordin decis in the constitut befor it revis the presid wa the coordin of these three power howev no mechan on how to coordin the three had been envisag in the constitut but in the current constitut thi coordin ha been creat with the emerg of a new institut in the form of the snsc in short we can say that in the snsc defens or polit decis or in other word militari and state decis on the one hand and the decis by the three power on the other are coordin and import issu that are connect with our nation secur be they polit militari law enforc intellig econom cultur or other issu are discuss and decid upon in the snsc the head of the three power two repres of the esteem leader and three polit secur minist such as the interior foreign affair and inform minist are present also the command in chief who is the highest rank militari offici as well as the head of the plan and budget organ who is actual the coordin of the countri s economi are also present occasion other minist are invit to particip when the topic to be discuss requir their presenc thi council wa effect in end the differ between iran and iraq at that junctur and in free the prison of war as well as in settl the issu of the part of our border still under iraqi occup the famou letter that were exchang between the iranian presid and saddam husayn were letter that had been discuss by the snsc these letter were extrem effect and import the decis that the snsc adopt dure iraq s war against kuwait were extrem import also the decis that the snsc adopt vi a vi the disintegr of the soviet union were also veri import i should point out that the snsc had foreseen the disintegr of the soviet union at least two year befor it took place and had actual conclud how mani countri the soviet union would be split into and what stanc we should adopt toward it it had even foreseen the plot that the western and especi the american want to hatch in thi region as mani as three year befor and had foreseen that world arrog would one day provok some in the area to confront iran s territori integr of cours it is necessari to explain that the snsc s discuss and deliber becom valuabl when they are also endors by the esteem leader in which case they are implement as a compulsori decis i think that thi institut ha been veri favor for the islam republ of iran
